The decision date is (1996-02-05)\\n\\nJUSTICE BUCKLEY\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nPlaintiff, Charlene Drayson, filed an action in the circuit court seeking a declaratory judgment that certain conditions and a right to repurchase contained in the deed from defendant, George Wolff, to plaintiff’s predecessor in interest, are illegal restraints on alienation. Plaintiff also requested a judgment that she is entitled to a permanent, \"transferrable” easement across the remaining property of defendant. Upon being served, defendant removed the action to Federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. The district court remanded the case to the circuit court because it found that it did not have jurisdiction due to the lack of a case or controversy between the parties.\\nWhile the case was pending in Federal court, the parties filed motions for summary judgment. After the case was remanded to the circuit court, plaintiff requested a hearing on the summary judgment motions filed in Federal court. After a hearing, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant, finding the terms of the deed to be reasonable restraints on alienation. Plaintiff now appeals the circuit court order.\\nBACKGROUND\\nSince about 1953, defendant’s family owned 30 acres of real property located in Hanover Township, Cook County, Illinois. This property was used as the family residence until October 1980, when defendant severed and sold approximately 4.577 acres of the property. This parcel, on which the home stands, was conveyed to La Salle National Bank as trustee for Carl LoDico. In order to preserve the character of this home and land, defendant conveyed the land subject to conditions subsequent and retained a right to repurchase. He did this with the intention of rejoining this property with the remainder of the original 30 acres at some point in the future.',\n",

Exhibit B contains a section titled \"Deed Conditions,” which is included in the appendix of this opinion, but will be briefly summarized here. This section restricts the use of the property to only single-family residential purposes for a period of 39 years\\n1\\n. Only one dwelling house of at least 3,000 square feet is permitted on the property and the existing home is to be maintained. The deed is also subject to the condition that all real estate taxes he paid in a timely fashion. The instrument specifically states that the conditions are to be construed as express conditions subsequent as between the parties, \"their heirs, successors and assignees.” Finally, the instrument gives the grantor and his successors and assignees the right to retake the property if a grantee fails to comply with any of the conditions and does not remedy a breach after the grantor has given notice.\\nDefendant still owns the remaining 24 acres, which are contiguous to plaintiffs property in three directions. The boundary line between these properties is exceedingly irregular. To allow defendant an opportunity to repurchase the home some day in the future, exhibit B of the original deed also reserved in defendant a right to repurchase if the property was ever sold or assigned. The right to repurchase is. also included in the appendix, but the terms can be summarized as follows.',\n",

Written notice of the grantee’s intent to transfer must be given to the grantor not less than 60 days prior to the contemplated transfer. The grantor has 30 days from the date he receives notice of an intent to transfer to exercise the right to repurchase. The sale price is to be set as the lesser of the price set forth in a sales contract with a third party or the fair market value as determined by three appraisers.\\nAfter the original sale to LoDico, the property was sold in 1985 to Mr. and Mrs. Perez, with an explicit waiver by defendant of his right to repurchase for that sale. Plaintiff and her late husband acquired title to the property in July 1991. The deed at issue here is recorded in plaintiff’s chain of title.\\nOn August 6, 1993, plaintiff commenced this action seeking a declaration that the deed conditions and the right to repurchase together constitute an unreasonable and invalid restraint on alienation. Plaintiff also sought a declaration that the right to repurchase was not binding upon her as a remote grantee, and asked for a permanent, unlimited, and \"transferable” easement over defendant’s property.\\nDefendant removed the case to Federal court and plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Defendant made a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on the merits, and also sought dismissal of the complaint on the grounds that there was no actual case or controversy, it was not ripe and plaintiff lacked standing.

The decision date is (1996-02-05)\\n\\nThe circuit court did not abuse its discretion in granting a declaratory judgment. An actual controversy existed between the parties as to whether the deed provisions at issue are valid. While it is true that plaintiff has not failed to comply with the conditions or right to repurchase, the mere existence of these deed provisions provides the court with a concrete basis on which to declare the parties’ rights. Plaintiffs allegations that these provisions are illegal clouds on her title create the controversy here. There is nothing hypothetical or speculative about plaintiffs or defendant’s arguments; they pertain only to the deed, which is at no risk of changing and is not abstract.\\nII. DEED PROVISIONS\\nPlaintiff argues that the deed conditions and the right to repurchase, taken together, are void because they unreasonably restrain the alienation of the property. Apparently, plaintiff admits that either the deed conditions or the right to repurchase, standing alone, would be valid. However, we find that the fact that a single deed contains both of these provisions does not make it any greater a restraint on alienation because the\\' conditions in the deed affect the type of fee transferred and do nothing to restrain the alienation of the property.\\nThe Restatement of Property defines an estate in fee simple subject to a condition subsequent as \"an otherwise effective conveyance of land,” which: \"(a) creates an estate in fee simple; and (b) provides that upon the occurrence of a stated event the conveyor or his successor in interest shall have the power to terminate the estate so created.” (Restatement of Property § 45 (1936).) We have no doubt that such an estate was conveyed by defendant here.',\n",

Plaintiff has not disputed that her estate is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent and has provided no authority for her argument that the conditions of her estate restrain alienation.\\nThe conditions contained in the deed state that thé land must be used for residential purposes only and that the existing home must be maintained. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate how these conditions in any way prohibit or restrain her from transferring her property. Plaintiff can transfer exactly what she owns: a fee simple subject to conditions subsequent. Plaintiff claims the conditions prohibit her from \"conveying the property to anyone who would seek to subdivide or otherwise develop the property for the highest and best use permitted by law.” The deed does not prohibit her from conveying the property to a developer. It prohibits a developer from using the property for anything other than a single-family residence until the year 2019. This is because plaintiff can convey no more than she owns. She cannot convey a fee simple absolute to a developer because she does not own one.\\nPlaintiff cannot expect the courts to give her more than she bargained for. There have been no allegations of fraud or misrepresentations that would have led plaintiff to believe that she received a fee simple absolute.

This power is now regarded as an attribute of ownership and may not be restrained unreasonably. The supreme court summarized the law in Illinois regarding restraints in Gale v. York Center Community Cooperative, Inc. (1960), 21 Ill. 2d 86, 171 N.E.2d 30:\\n\"Thus, as a general rule, restraints on alienation are void ***.

If accepted social and economic considerations dictate that a partial restraint is reasonably necessary for their fulfillment, such a restraint should be sustained. *** In short, the law of property, like other areas of the law, is not a mathematical science but takes shape at the direction of social and economic forces in an ever changing society, and decisions should be made to turn on these considerations.” Gale, 21 Ill. 2d at 92-93, 171 N.E.2d at 33.',\n",

The association had the right of first refusal for 12 months if a member wished to sell or transfer a membership and title to his or her home. After the member offered the membership to the association, the association had 12 months to exercise its right to purchase at either the proposed selling price, the price agreed upon between the member and the association, or the price determined by an impartial appraisal. The court upheld the right of first refusal, reasoning that the utility of the restraints in the agreement outweighed any injurious consequences to the public.

Bruken Realty Corp. (1986), 67 N.Y.2d 156, 492 N.E.2d 379, 501 N.Y.S.2d 306, the State of New York granted to a subsidiary corporation of Pennsylvania a right to purchase 12 lots in a freight yard if it was determined within the following 99 years that the property was no longer needed for New York’s transportation operations. The instrument provided that the right had to be exercised within 90 days after New York decided to sell, and the purchase price would be determined by arbitration. The right to purchase was challenged as an unreasonable restraint on alienation. The court determined that the right of first refusal to purchase the lots did not violate the rule prohibiting unreasonable restraints on alienation because the terms of duration and price were reasonable and there was the beneficial purpose of permitting the parties to put the properties at issue to their maximum productive use for the public.

A preemptive right, however, usually will not be unlawful when conditioned on payment of market value or a sum equal to a third-party offer [citations].

The decision date is (1996-02-05)\\n\\nThe right to repurchase at issue here provides that the right must be exercised within 30 days from the date the grantor receives notice of the owner’s intent to sell, transfer or assign. Price is determined by the lower price of either the offer from a third party or the market price determined by three appraisers. Both of these terms are reasonable. Plaintiff’s argument that this process is burdensome and likely to prohibit the sale of the property is weakened by the fact that the land has been sold twice since this right was created.\\nFinally, the purpose of the right is also reasonable. Plaintiff’s property is a little over 4.5 acres carved out of the middle of the original 30-acre plot of land. The boundaries are jagged and it does not seem that the whole of the original 30 acres could be put to effective use without the two parcels being reunited in the future. Although the purpose behind the restraint appears to be only personal, the effective use of personal property is an accepted social and economic end. We do not believe that the \"injurious consequences” that would flow from the enforcement of this right of refusal outweigh the utility of the restraint. (Gale, 21 Ill. 2d at 92,171 N.E.2d at 33.) Therefore, we hold that the right to repurchase is not an unreasonable restraint on alienation.\\nPlaintiff’s final argument is that she is not bound by the right to repurchase. A covenant will be deemed to run with the land if: (1) the parties so intended, (2) the covenant touches and concerns the land, and (3) there is privity of estate between the parties. (Streams Sports Club, Ltd. v. Richmond (1983), 99 Ill. 2d 182, 188, 457 N.E.2d 1226, 1230.) The right to repurchase does not explicitly state that it is binding upon successors or assignees of the grantee. However, as our supreme court has stated:',\n",

(La Salle National Trust v. Village of Westmont (1994), 264 Ill. App. 3d 43, 71, 636 N.E.2d 1157, 1174.) Here, the right to repurchase, by its very terms, concerns the occupation of the land. It concerns the process by which the owner must sell the property. Also, the land itself, which is irregularly carved out of the original 30-acre parcel, indicates that the right to repurchase relates to the enjoyment of the land, in that it will be better enjoyed if joined with the remainder of the original 30-acre parcel.\\nFinally, it is not disputed that there is privity of estate.

The decision date is (1898-02-14)\\n\\nIt appears from the record that the complainant had trouble with her husband and sought redress in the police court, where she was introduced to McG-uire as an attorney, and he took her to Burdette, and she employed Burdette to procure for her a divorce and the custody of a small boy, her only child. She testified that the defendant Burdette agreed to attend to the divorce case for her for the sum of §50. On the other hand, Burdette set up in his answer and testified on the trial that complainant agreed to pay him for his services in the divorce case a retainer of §50 in cash, and in addition one-half of all money and property recovered or obtained of the defendant in the divorce proceeding. The bill for divorce was filed about the middle of May, 1896, on the ground of cruelty. The case was prepared for trial, but on the 12th day of November the parties, through their attorneys, came to an agreement, under which a decree for divorce was obtained. Complainant was given the custody of the child, and the defendant was decreed to convey her two certain lots in Chicago as alimony, and §35 was awarded as solicitor’s fees. On the 20th day of November, 1896, appellee Burdette demanded a deed of appellant for one of the lots, in payment of solicitor’s fees in the divorce proceeding. The appellant executed the deed, and on the 21st of the following month filed this bill to set aside the deed. On the hearing, on the pleadings and evidence, the court entered a decree dismissing the bill for want of equity, and complainant appealed.',\n",

As has been seen, the decree for divorce was obtained on the 12th day of November, and Burdette contends that the relation of attorney and client then terminated. We think, however, it is apparent from the testimony of Burdette himself that the relation of attorney and client did not terminate on that day. He testified that after the decree was signed, Mrs. Willin, her father and mother, and a number of others, all went over to his office. He further testified: “There was no attempt at settlement of her business affairs that day. The parties all went home, and I notified Mrs. Willin, my client, a few days afterwards, to come to my office and execute the deeds to the property. The decree vested these lots in her and other lots in Mr. Willin. I proposed to have her execute a quit-claim deed to the property of which she was divested, and he would execute a deed to her. The decree had then been entered. I think the day she came in I delivered a copy to her. She came in on November 20, with Mr. Petterson. Mr. McGuire was in, talking to me, when they came. I showed her the two deeds, and I said I thought she ought to make a deed to Mr. Willin and she ought to make a deed to me and Mr. McGuire.”',\n",

In the discharge of that part of his duty as an attorney he prepared and handed appellant, on the 20th day of November, a deed to be executed to her former husband, and at the same time he requested her to execute the deed in controversy. Moreover, his statement of account to appellant, showing the amounts received and disbursed in payment of costs and other purposes, was not rendered until November 27,—seven days after the deed in controversy was executed.

The appellant, being a client when the deed was made, was not required to establish fraud or imposition in order to defeat the instrument. The relation having been shown when the deed was executed, the burden of proof rests upon the attorney to show fairness, adequacy and equity, and upon failure to make proof, a court of equity will treat the case as one of constructive fraud.

In the Morrison case, Weeks on Attorneys and Counselors is quoted with approval, as follows (p. 316): “The attorney who bargains in a matter of advantage to himself with his client is bound to show that the transaction is fair and equitable; that he fully and faithfully discharged his duties to his client, without misrepresentation or concealment of any fact material to the client; that the client was fully informed of his rights and interests in the subject matter of the transaction and the nature and effect-of the contract, sale or gift, and was so placed as to be able to deal with his attorney at arm’s length.”',\n",

(Laclede Bank v. Keeler, 109 Ill. 385.) But, under the law as established in the authorities cited, can the deed be sustained? As has been seen, appellee Burdette claims that he was entitled to the deed under the contract made with appellant, to the effect that he was to be paid a retainer of $50, and in addition was to have one-half of all money or property obtained in the divorce proceeding from appellant’s husband. Burdette testified to the contract, but he is not corroborated by any other witness. His co-defendant, McGuire, in his testimony corroborates Burdette as to the retainer of $50, but, as we understand his testimony, goes no further; while, on the other hand, the complainant expressly denies the contract claimed by Burdette, and testifies that he agreed to take the case and prosecute it to a final termination for $50. So far, therefore, as reliance is placed on proof of a contract under which the deed was made, the evidence does not seem to preponderate in favor of Burdette.',\n",

Appellees testified that $500 would be a reasonable fee, and T. J. Lumbard, an attorney, testified that $350 to $400, in .his opinion, would be a reasonable fee. On the other hand, E. H. Taylor, an attorney in general practice, testified that $75 would-be a customary fee; and Pease and Knecht, two attorneys in general practice, testified that $100 would be a reasonable and customary fee, so that the evidence, in view of the testimony on the value of the services, preponderates against appellees. It appears from Burdette’s own statement of account furnished appellant, that he has received in cash, over and above all money paid out, the sum of $104.52. Having received this sum, under the preponderance of the evidence he was paid all his services were worth at the time he procured the deed from appellant. After having received what his services were worth, he demanded a deed of appellant of the lot in controversy, and, as she testified, threatened to make her trouble unless she made the deed. True, Burdette denies the threats; but it is apparent that appellant did not willingly make the deed, otherwise she would not have filed a bill to set it aside so soon after it was executed, the bill having been filed only thirty-one days after the deed was made.\\nDoes the transaction show fairness, adequacy and equity, as is declared essential in Jennings v. McConnel, supra, to sustain a conveyance where the relation of attorney and client exists? We do not think it does. Under the evidence we see no ground upon which the deed can be sustained. The appellant was ignorant of her rights. She was uneducated, not being able to read or write, with the exception of being able to write her own name, and iE appellee Burdette had fully informed her of all her rights, as it was his duty to do, it is apparent the deed never would have been executed by her.',\n",

Hayes, to recover three horses. The defendant pleaded that he was sheriff, and had seized the horses by virtue of certain executions against plaintiff’s husband. The verdict and judgment were for the defendant.\\nCounsel for appellant insist that the court erred in overruling a motion to strike certain pleas from the files, but this motion was not preserved in the bill of exceptions. Motions of this character, and the decision of the court thereon, are made a part of the record only hy a bill of exceptions.\\nThe judgments upon which the executions issued were properly admitted in evidence, except that in favor of Harriet L. Guier. This was a judgment originally rendered before a justice of the peace, in 1863, and no execution was issued thereon until 1869, when one was issued, and returned mulla, l>ona. A transcript was then filed in the clerk’s office of the circuit court, and execution issued.\\nIf execution is not issued on a judgment in a court of record within a year, it so far loses its vitality that none can issue until the judgment has been revived. Greater effect should not be given to a judgment before a justice than to a judgment of a court of record, and, if the party recovering such a judgment fails to sue out an execution within a year from its rendition, his only remedy would be another suit upon the judgment. This judgment was improperly admitted in evidence, but it worked the plaintiff no harm, as the justification of the officer was complete under the others, and its admission is therefore no ground for reversal.',\n",

St. ch. 38, ¶ 756) provides: “In cases where the party pleads 'guilty,’ such plea shall not be entered until the court shall have fully explained to the accused the consequences of entering such plea; after which, if the party persists in pleading 'guilty,’ such plea shall be received and recorded, and the court shall proceed to render judgment and execution thereon, as if he had been found guilty by a jury. In all cases where the court possesses any discretion as to the extent of the punishment, it shall be the duty of the court to examine witnesses as to the aggravation and mitigation of the offense.” The record in this case does not show that the trial court warned plaintiff in error or admonished him of the consequences of his plea of guilty as provided by the above statute. If the provisions of that statute are mandatory and a compliance with the same must appear from the record, then the contention of plaintiff in error is well founded and this judgment must be reversed.' It has been held by the Supreme and Appellate Courts of this State that a plea of guilty in a criminal case can only be entered after the defendant has been fully advised by the court of his rights and the consequences of his plea of guilty. (Krolage v. People, 224 Ill. 456; People v. Glick, 200 Ill. App. 46.) It has also been held that this statute applies to misdemeanors as well as to felonies. (Pepple v. Sweetland, 210 Ill. App. 432.) It would also appear that the Supreme Court has held that a. court of review cannot presume that the trial court performed its duty under this statute in the absence of anything in the record to show a compliance with the statute, but that the record must affirmatively show that the trial court did explain to the defendant the consequences of a plea of guilty.

The bank certifying, does not warrant the genuineness of the body of the check. In Marine National Bank v. National City Bank, 59 N. Y. 67, it was held :\\n“ When a check is presented for certification to a bank upon which it is drawn, the purpose is to ascertain with certainty what the bank alone can know, and that is whether the drawer of the check has funds sufficient to meet it, and further to obtain the engagement of the bank that those funds shall not be withdrawn from the bank by the drawer of the check.”\",\n",

It must be noted that in the Merchants’ National Bank case, the raised check was certified February 13, 1894, and on the next day the check was paid by the Merchants’ National Bank to appellant, and three days thereafter, a question having arisen as to the correct amount of the draft, the Merchants’ National Bank went to the Metropolitan National Bank and made a demand upon it to redeem the draft, leaving the draft with the bank. But in the case at bar, the raised draft in question was certified February 9, 1894, and on that day paid to the Metropolitan National Bank. Four days thereafter, appellant learned that said draft was fraudulently raised from $33 to $3,300, but for the long period of nearly five years, and not until November 29, 1898, did appellant inform appellee of its discovery of fraud or make a demand upon appellee to return the money paid by it to the Metropolitan National Bank. In the Merchants’ National Bank case it was made to appear that the money collected upon the draft was still to the credit of the American Trust and Savings Bank. In the case at bar, it appears that many years prior to the making of the demand, the money collected thereon had been withdrawn by the American Trust and Savings Bank and in the one case the draft was returned by the Merchants’ National Bank to the Metropolitan National Bank, while in\" this case the draft has never been returned or offered to the Metropolitan National Bank.

In Schroeder v. Harvey, 75 Ill. 638, the court say:\\n“ In Simms v.

As the right to seek and compel restoration and payment from the person committing the forgeries, was in itself a valuable one, it is sufficient if it appears that the bank by reason of the negligence of the depositors, was prevented from promptly, and, it may be effectively, exercising it.”',\n",

It is to be presumed under the facts of this case, that there has been a change of circumstances in the position of the parties otherwise liable, and therefore that through the negligence of appellant in not promptly notifying appellee of the alteration of the draft, the appellee has been prejudiced; and if prejudiced, it follows that the delay in giving said notice was unreasonable and under the authorities such delay as would preclude recovery. It is true questions of fact, under proper instructions of law, are usually for the jury, but when the evidence given at the trial with all the inferences that the jury could justifiably draw from it, is so insufficient to support a verdict for the plaintiff that such a verdict, if returned, must be set aside, the court is not bound to submit the case to the jury, but may direct a verdict for the defendant.\\nIn the case at bar, the \"facts are not disputed.

The decision date is (1903-04-14)\\n\\nThe conduct of appellant, as shown by this record, may justly lead to the conclusion that it had adopted the draft in the condition it was when paid, and had determined not to look to appellee for its repayment. This conclusion is sustained by the record, whereby it appears, that almost immediately upon the discovery of the forgery, appellant commenced an attachment suit against Harper. In the affidavit for an attachment,appellant states that said Harper was indebted to it in the sum of $3,300, upon a certain draft, and in said proceedings a part of said $o,300 was reached by service upon the American Trust and Savings Bank, as garnishee. The president of appellant stated in his affidavit attached to the declaration in said cause, that said Harper was indebted to it upon a certain draft upon which it advanced $3,300 to the American Trust and Savings Bank at defendant’s request, and default was entered against Harper about two years thereafter; so that appellant has but to take judgment and then may recover the amount in the hands of the garnishee. We do not hold that the institution of an attachment suit will, in all cases, preclude a bank from recovering a judgment against a party to whom it has paid money b}’’ mistake upon a raised draft, but we are of the opinion that when, as under the facts of this «case, a bank which has paid out money by mistake upon a raised check elects not to inform the bank of the forgery, so that it may protect itself, but elects to proceed, as in this case, against the payee of the draft, it is such conduct as will tend to preclude a recovery from the bank to which the money was originally paid. In the case at bar, the draft itself was never returned, or offered to be returned to appellee.',\n",

In the Merchants’ National Bank' case, supra, the court said :\\n“ The draft was turned over to appellant and by it retained until it made investigation, whereupon, having refused to redeem the draft, appellant returned it to appellee and can not be heard now in the face of these facts, to claim that appellee should again offer.”\\nIt is apparent from this and many other authorities that a return or proper tender of the draft was essential, or some act shown on the part of appellee, making such return or tender useless. Even if a return of the draft had been made about five years after the discovery of the forgery and its payment, it would have been too late presumptively to have availed appellee and therefore would not have been such a return or tender of the draft as reason and authority require. This record does not show that appellee has not been injured by appellant’s conduct. Appellant has shielded Harper as aforesaid, and has thus actively prevented appellee or the American Trust and Savings Bank from prosecuting him or attaching his property by concealing from all parties interested to know, a knowledge of the forgery or alteration of the raised check, through a long period, in which appellee and others interested might have protected themselves against loss.\\nAfter a careful examination of the record and a consideration of the suggestions made by counsel, and without extending this opinion in further comment, we are of the opinion that appellant, by its conduct as shown in this record, is estopped from a recovery.

The next day the appellee Dr. Marshall took the patient to Chicago to the Presbyterian Hospital and called Dr. Graham, an eminent surgeon of Chicago, who performed a surgical operation on him. He cut down upon the blood vessel, cleaned out the cavity which was filled with blood clot, sought out the bleeding vessel, tied it, sewed up the wound and dressed it. It was the axillary artery that was ruptured. Dr. Graham testified that at that time the head of the humerus or head of the bone was in the socket, where it belonged.

The great weight of testimony seems to show that appellees used reasonable skill in treating the dislocated shoulder, that the shoulder was properly reduced in the first instance, and that they used reasonable skill in all their subsequent treatment.\\nSeveral of the most eminent physicians of Chicago give it as their opinion that the appellees’ treatment of appellant’s wound was good practice in every step.

But the physicians spoken of say that that” was proper advice to give.\\nSpeaking on this point, Dr. Owens says : “ Patients don’t always get the benefits that we hope they will get in cases where the shoulder has been dislocated, but that advice was such as a surgeon in good practice would give under the circumstances.”\\nThe evidence also tends to show that the rupture of the axillary artery necessitating the surgical operation to be performed in Chicago, and the performing of it, was the probable cause of the shoulder becoming again dislocated, if it was so. It is true that there was some opposing testimony to that given on behalf of the appellees, but the jury were the judges of the weight to be given to it.\\nA physician is not an insurer of the success of his treatment, and is entitled to pay for his services whether he succeeds in curing his patient or not, provided he uses the skill of an ordinarily skillful physician.\\nThe appellant in this case has met with a most serious misfortune, but the evidence failed to show, in the estimation of the jury, that appellees were in any way to blame for it, or failed to treat appellant’s shoulder in a reasonably skillful manner according to the practice of surgeons.\\nThere appears to be much feeling in the case on the part of the parties litigant, and the attorneys on each side seem to participate in such feeling in an unusual degree.

The trial court granted the motion and defendants were served a copy of the amended complaint.\\nOn September 8, 2003, the Pervans moved to dismiss the complaint, contending Pruitt’s claim against them was barred by the statute of limitations. Pruitt contended the amended complaint related back to her original complaint under section 2 — 616(d) of the Code. At a hearing on the Pervans’ motion, the following discussion occurred:\\n“[THE COURT]: *** I don’t understand why the owners weren’t sued in the first place when you know that somebody was simply a manager of the property.\\n[PRUITT’S ATTORNEY]: We didn’t know the identity of the\\nowners until after the statute ran.\\n* * *\\n[THE COURT]: *** You had no idea to sue the owner of the building? You just wanted to sue who you considered — you felt that Wolin was the manager of the building. You had no intention of suing the owner?\\n[PRUITT’S ATTORNEY]: Well, Judge, hindsight is 20-20.1 must concede that.\\n* H4 *\\nHindsight is 20-20. What I am saying now, I represent someone that did not live in the building, someone that went to visit and fell there. We see that [Wolin-Levin] is the management company. But it turns out from deposing [Vasilj], that he said that this maintenance issues [sic] we do not do, the owners did it.\\nv\\n[THE COURT]: It seems to me that you sue the management thinking that the management had the responsibility for changing bulbs and other routine—\\n[PRUITT’S ATTORNEY]: For managing the building.\\n[THE COURT]: And for managing the building. That’s who you intended to sue and that’s who you thought was hable.\\n[PRUITT’S ATTORNEY]: Right.”\\nThe trial court determined Pruitt’s amended complaint did not meet the “mistaken identity” requirement of section 2 — 616(d) and granted the Pervans’ motion.

The decision date is (2005-02-15)\\n\\n1There are very few Illinois opinions discussing this section of the Code since its amendment became effective in 2002. The previous version of the statute listed five requirements a party had to meet before an amended complaint would relate back to an earlier pleading. Three of those requirements, including that the “failure to join the person as a defendant was inadvertent,” do not appear in the amended statute. 735 ILCS 5/2 — 616(d) (West 2002); 735 ILCS 5/2 — 616(d) (West 2000). Instead, section 2 — 616(d) now requires that would-be defendants “knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against him or her.” (Emphasis added.) 735 ILCS 5/2 — 616(d)(2) (West 2002).\\nBy amending this section, the legislature intended to impose more stringent requirements for amended complaints — like those embodied in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Compton v. Ubilluz, 351 Ill. App. 3d 223, 233-34, 811 N.E.2d 1225 (2004). Before examining the requirements of section 2 — 616(d), the court must assess whether the section applies at all. That is, is this a case of mistaken identity? See Fassero v. Turigliatto, 349 Ill. App. 3d 368, 370-74, 811 N.E.2d 252 (2004); see also Manney v. Monroe, 151 F. Supp. 2d 976, 998 (N.D. Ill. 2001) (no identity mistake under Rule 15(c)(2) of the Federal Rules of Procedure where the plaintiffs failure to initially name the defendant until after the limitations period expired was due to his ignorance of the defendant’s involvement in the alleged wrong).',\n",

App. 3d at 370-74, the court conducted this preliminary analysis before determining whether the plaintiff met section 2 — 616(d)’s requirements. There, the plaintiff was injured in a car accident. Todd Turigliatto was driving the other vehicle involved in the accident. Todd’s brother, Thomas Turigliatto, owned the vehicle. The plaintiff said the driver identified himself as Thomas at the scene of the accident, so she filed a complaint naming Thomas as the defendant. When plaintiff discovered Todd was the driver, and not Thomas, she moved to amend her complaint and name Todd as the defendant instead. Fassero, 349 Ill. App. 3d at 369-70.\\nThe court examined the plaintiffs intent in bringing the suit to determine if the case involved mistaken identity. Fassero, 349 Ill. App. 3d at 371. The plaintiffs intent was gleaned from the record, especially by looking at whom the plaintiff named as a defendant in the complaint. The plaintiff’s complaint addressed the conduct of the driver of the vehicle — “[njowhere in the complaint [did plaintiff] allege the owner of the vehicle violated his duty of care to her.” Fassero, 349 Ill. App. 3d at 374. Based on the complaint, the court found the plaintiff mistakenly believed the driver’s name was Thomas instead of Todd — a classic mistaken identity situation. Fassero, 349 Ill. App. 3d at 374.\\nWe believe Fassero is distinguishable and in that distinction lies our rationale for affirming the trial judge. There, the plaintiff intended to sue the driver of the vehicle that collided with hers. She mistakenly believed the driver’s first name was Thomas, instead of Todd. She never intended to sue Thomas, the owner of the vehicle.',\n",

The complaint alleged negligence in the management of the Property. Pruitt correctly identified Wolin-Levin as the Property’s management company. Wolin-Levin remains a defendant in this case.\\nConversely, Pruitt did not intend to sue the owners when she filed her original complaint. Pruitt apparently did not believe the Pervans had breached any duty as the owners of the Property. She must have assumed Wolin-Levin was solely responsible for maintaining the Property’s stairways. We know this assumption did not change until six months after the limitations period expired. That is when Pruitt deposed Vasilj and learned the Pervans were responsible for the Property’s maintenance. One month later Pruitt added the Pervans as defendants in her amended complaint.\\nPruitt’s initial failure to name the Pervans as defendants was not a mistake under section 2 — 616(d). There was no “mistake concerning the identity of the proper party.” See 735 ILCS 5/2— 616(d)(2) (West 2002). She simply lacked information of the Pervans’ involvement in maintaining the Property. As stated in Pruitt’s brief on appeal:\\n“In [Pruitt’s] original complaint, [Pruitt] assumed the management company alone maintained the building as such was responsible for the negligent acts or omissions. However, upon taking the deposition of the property manager, Vasilj, an employee of Wolin-Levin, he testified that the stairway maintenance duties were done by the owners as such, the owners are the objects of the negligent acts alleged in the complaint concerning the stairway.”',\n",

The decision date is (1983-02-14)\\n\\nJUSTICE GREEN\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nOn July 28, 1981, an information was filed in the circuit court of Ford County purporting to charge defendant, Robert H. Smith, with the offense of reckless homicide (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 38, par. 9— 3(a)). On March 30, 1982, at the conclusion of a trial, the jury returned verdicts finding defendant guilty of that offense and of the offense of failing to reduce speed to avoid an accident (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 951/2, par. 11 — 601(a)). The latter verdict was returned upon a form submitted to the jury at defendant’s request upon his contention that, under the circumstances, the offense of failing to reduce speed was an included offense of reckless homicide. On that same day, judgments of conviction were entered on both verdicts. On May 3, 1982, defendant’s motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial were denied. On May 3, 1982, the court sentenced defendant on the reckless homicide conviction to 30 months’ probation conditioned upon 24 consecutive weeks of periodic imprisonment to be served on weekends. No sentence was imposed for the other conviction.\\nDefendant appeals both convictions and the sentence. He maintains the reckless homicide conviction is invalid because, as alleged in his motion in arrest of judgment, the information failed to charge the offense of reckless homicide, because it did not allege that the acts he was charged with were performed recklessly. He further requests that, if the reckless homicide conviction is permitted to stand, the other conviction should be reversed on double jeopardy grounds.\\nSection 9 — 3(a) of the Criminal Code of 1961 defines reckless homicide in the following manner.',\n",

An act performed recklessly is performed wantonly, within the meaning of a statute using the latter term, unless the statute clearly requires another meaning.” Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 38, par. 4 — 6.\\nThe information charged that on July 26, 1981, defendant “committed the offense of Reckless Homicide” in that:\\n“Above defendant did unintentionally kill an individual without lawful justification by committing an act which was likely to cause death or great bodily harm to an individual, said act consisting in the driving of a motor vehicle at an excessive rate of speed resulting in the crash which resulted in the death of Christopher Gulliford, Age 22, of Gibson City, said act occurring within the Corporate limits of the City of Gibson, Ford County, Illinois.”\\nOther than alleging that defendant committed the offense of reckless homicide, the information did not use the word “reckless.”',\n",

The decision date is (1983-02-14)\\n\\nOther than alleging that defendant committed the offense of reckless homicide, the information did not use the word “reckless.”\\nA charge must allege every essential element of the offense. (People v. Pettus (1980), 84 Ill. App. 3d 390, 405 N.E.2d 489.) The only act charged of defendant in the information was that he drove at an excessive rate of speed. Excessive speed is insufficient, of itself, to constitute recklessness. (People v. Potter (1955), 5 Ill. 2d 365, 125 N.E.2d 510; People v. Clark (1970), 130 Ill. App. 2d 558, 265 N.E.2d 191; aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds (1972), 50 Ill. 2d 292, 278 N.E.2d 782.) However, a charge alleging that an accused drove at an excessive speed on a particular occasion and at a particular place was held to state the offense of reckless homicide under the predecessor to section 9 — 3(a) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1951, ch. 38, par. 364a) when the charge also alleged that the accused drove recklessly (Potter). Thus, the crucial question is whether the element of recklessness can be inferred from the information as a whole.',\n",

App. 3d 803, 293 N.E.2d 911, the charges alleging the offense of burglary did not include the statutory language “without authority” (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1971, ch. 38, par. 19— 1(a)), but the court deemed the element to have been inferred by allegation of the intent to commit a theft. Similar results have been reached in theft cases where “without authority” was not alleged, but intent to permanently deprive the owner was alleged. (People v. Wade (1970), 131 Ill. App. 2d 415, 264 N.E.2d 898; People v. Hayes (1971), 133 Ill. App. 2d 885, 272 N.E.2d 423.) On the other hand, when other allegations of the complaint do not imply the missing element, the charge fails when tested by a motion in arrest of judgment. In People v. Pruden (1982), 110 Ill. App. 3d 250, 442 N.E.2d 284, and People v. Pettus (1980), 84 Ill. App. 3d 390, 405 N.E.2d 489, lack of authority was not implied from allegations of the other elements of the offense of home invasion. Here, the information alleged that defendant’s conduct was likely to cause death or great bodily harm, but section 9 — 3(a) states that the accused’s conduct must be such as to be likely to do so and be performed recklessly. Thus, the conduct that is likely to cause death or great bodily harm does not, of itself, imply that the conduct was reckless.\\nWe are aware of no authority for judging the sufficiency of the charge by anything other than the description of the acts contained in the charge which the defendant is alleged to have performed. No case has been cited which indicates that the discovery given or the understanding of the parties can cure defects in a charge which are reached by a timely motion in the trial court.',\n",

The clear and explicit language of section 111 — 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure required that both the statutory provision cited and the nature and elements of the offense charged be set forth. One of the elements of the offense proscribed by section 24— l(a)(10) is that the weapon be loaded, and section 111 — 3 requires that it be alleged.” (Emphasis added.) (61 Ill. 2d 335, 338, 335 N.E.2d 437, 439-40.)\\nIn Pettus, designation of the offense as home invasion was insufficient to imply that the entry made into the home was without authority.',\n",

The decision date is (1983-02-14)\\n\\nIn Pettus, designation of the offense as home invasion was insufficient to imply that the entry made into the home was without authority.\\nIn Pujoue, the supreme court set forth the now well-recognized rule that when the sufficiency of a criminal charge is raised for the first time on appeal, the charge is sufficient if it contains sufficient specificity to enable the defendant to prepare his defense and to plead a resulting conviction as a bar to a subsequent prosecution arising from the same conduct. Clearly, the charge here met that standard, but the insufficiency asserted on appeal was raised in the trial court by a post-trial motion in arrest of judgment. Pujoue was a giant step forward in rejecting a procedure whereby a defendant adequately advised of the charges he must meet might remain silent about inadvertent shortcomings in the charge and then, if convicted, obtain reversal. However, the Pujoue doctrine has not been extended to situations, such as that here, where the sufficiency of the charge was raised by a motion in arrest of judgment in the trial court. The Pujoue opinion stated that the court was not deciding whether its relaxed requirements would be so extended. Later, in People v. Lutz (1978), 73 Ill. 2d 204, 383 N.E.2d 171, the supreme court expressly refused to do so.\\nThus, where a charge has an apparently inadvertent error of the nature here, a defendant may remain silent about the error until after verdict and by making a motion in arrest of judgment, have his conviction set aside. We are required to reverse the conviction for reckless homicide.\\nDefendant’s conviction for failing to reduce his speed to avoid an accident is covered by his notice of appeal. He does not dispute the validity of that conviction if his other conviction is reversed. As he requested the jury be permitted to find him guilty of that offense as an included offense, he is estopped to maintain it was not an included offense of the reckless homicide charged.

J.\\nThis is an appeal under the act of June 14, 1887, from an interlocutory order appointing a receiver. The appellee filed his bill to redeem from what he alleged was a mortgage to the appellant, though in the form of a warranty deed. The appellant denied that the conveyance was a mortgage, alleging that it was an absolute conveyance in fact as well as in form, with an agreement to re-convey upon terms. We need not inquire which is right. The bill alleged, and the appellee tried to prove, mismanagement of the property by the appellant. Whether the proof was sufficient, we will not consider.\\nThe appointment of a receiver seems to have been prompted by the understanding of the court that on a previous day the appellant had, before the court, agreed to some terms which, on the day the receiver was appointed, he would not abide by.\\nHowever litigious a mortgagee in possession may be, so long as anything is due him, the possession can not be taken from him and given to a receiver.

The trial court sentenced him to 24 years’ imprisonment. He appeals.\\nAt defendant’s trial, Edward Jeffries testified to the following when called as a witness for the State. On November 1, 1985, at approximately 10 p.m., Jeffries, the victim, Johnny Island, and an individual named Donnell were drinking a six-pack of beer near the mailboxes on the first floor of a public housing building at 3835 South Federal in Chicago. While the three men were near the mailboxes, defendant approached the building and went to the mailbox area. When defendant did so, the victim moved away from him to the other side of the mailboxes. When he moved away, Island teased defendant about a “prior incident that happened to him.” Defendant then told Island that, if defendant wanted to, he could get Island. Island then walked up and called defendant’s name. Defendant ignored Island and walked away toward a ramp leading to apartments in the project.\\nApproximately five minutes later, defendant came down the ramp and started running toward the three men. Jeffries told Island that defendant was coming and Island started to run away. When defendant reached the area of the mailboxes and while Island was still running away, defendant pulled out a black revolver. Island slipped while turning the corner of the wall containing the mailboxes and Jeffries heard a shot. When Island slipped, he was 7 to 10 feet away from defendant. When defendant fired the gun, he had both arms straight out in front of him pointing at Island’s back. After defendant had fired the shot, Jeffries asked him why he had shot at Island. Without responding, defendant walked past Jeffries and Donnell toward the ramp.',\n",

At that time, he heard Jeffries say, “There he is.” After closing his mailbox and removing three letters, defendant heard Island say, “We aren’t going to start nothing, cause that is over with.” Defendant knew what Island was talking about. Defendant testified that, in June 1985, Island hit him over the head with a Coca-Cola bottle when defendant attempted to intercede in an argument between Island and the stepdaughters of a friend of defendant. Defendant also testified that, in August 1985, he was waiting for a bus when Island walked up to him and apologized in a sarcastic tone for hitting him in June. While apologizing, Island circled defendant with a gallon wine container in his hand.\\nDefendant further testified that when he started toward his apartment after getting his mail, he was met by Island, Jeffries and a third person. Defendant continued toward his apartment while the three men attempted to go through his pockets. After defendant got into his apartment, he noticed that two of the three letters were not for him. Eventually, defendant decided to go out for something to eat. Before leaving his apartment with the two misdirected letters, defendant decided to take his pistol with him because the three men might still be downstairs.',\n",

At that time, Jeffries said “[T]here he is again,” and Island asked in a loud tone, “What are you doing back down here?” Defendant turned in Island’s direction. Defendant saw the silhouette of a person he identified as Island from the voice. Island had his arm in a striking position, i.e., slightly behind the body at about a 45-degree angle and at waist height, while holding a can or other object. Defendant believed that Island was going to strike him. Defendant formed this belief because of Island’s conduct toward him, Jeffries saying “Hit him, hit him,” and because Island had struck him in the past. At that point, defendant pulled out his pistol, pointed in Island’s direction and cocked it. Defendant denied any intent to shoot Island at that time, stated that he pulled the pistol because he was “frightened and scared,” and claimed that he pulled it “just to scare” Island. Defendant further testified that as he cocked the pistol, he took two steps back. As he took the first step back, he saw Island turn. As he took the second step back, his right shoulder bumped the mailboxes, which caused the pistol to go off.\\nOn cross-examination, defendant characterized his first encounter with Island and Jeffries as a “brief argument.” He further claimed that he pulled the gun on Island because of fear for his life.',\n",

The statement substantially corroborated defendant’s testimony regarding the sequence of events leading up to the shooting of Island. However, there was no mention in the statement of the fact that defendant left his apartment to buy something to eat, in addition to returning two misdirected letters to his mailbox. Nor was there any mention in the statement that defendant took his pistol with him for his protection. Finally, there was no mention in the statement that defendant shot Island accidentally. In addition to introducing the statement in its case in chief, the State used the statement to impeach defendant’s testimony on these three latter points.\\nOpinion\\nOn appeal, defendant first contends he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Specifically, he asserts that the testimony of Jeffries, the State’s only occurrence witness, was incredible because the facts “suggest” that Jeffries was intoxicated at the time of the shooting. Defendant further likens Jeffries to a narcotics addict, whose testimony must be closely scrutinized. See, e.g., People v. Galloway (1974), 59 Ill. 2d 158, 319 N.E.2d 498.\\nWe find the “suggestion” in the record of Jeffries’ intoxication at the time of the shooting wholly insufficient to. render his testimony incredible and, therefore, to raise a reasonable doubt of defendant’s guilt. Nor is there any evidence in the record that Jeffries habitually used or abused alcohol. As such, there is no record basis for defendant’s comparison of Jeffries to a narcotics addict. Thus, neither the trial court nor jury was required to scrutinize his testimony as closely as that of a narcotics addict.',\n",

The gun actually used in the incident had been inadvertently destroyed by the State.\\nWe do not agree. People v. Seals (1987), 153 Ill. App. 3d 417, 505 N.E.2d 1107, dealing with exactly the same issue, is dispositive of defendant’s claim. Therein the court stated:\\n“Demonstrative evidence can be used to make other testimony more understandable. [Citation.] If it provides a visual aid for the jury, it should be used for factual explanation, not dramatic effect. [Citation.] The use of demonstrative evidence is within the discretion of the trial court.” Seals, 153 Ill. App. 3d at 423.\\nLike the Seals defendant, defendant here admitted firing the gun that caused the death and his defense was based on a theory of self-defense. Also, as in Seals, the jury was told that the gun demonstrated at trial was not the gun used in the shooting. Comparably to Seals, the gun was used briefly during the testimony of a police officer and by the prosecutor in closing argument but was not permitted to go to the jury. In view of the limited use of the similar gun, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting it into evidence. Seals, 153 Ill. App. 3d at 424.\\nDefendant next asserts that the State did not prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt because it did not disprove beyond such a doubt that he shot Island accidentally while acting in self-defense. The State responds that defendant failed to adequately raise the affirmative defense of self-defense so as to require it to disprove the claim beyond a reasonable doubt. The State relies on defendant’s testimony that he did not intend to shoot anyone and that he shot Island accidentally.',\n",

The decision date is (1989-06-14)\\n\\nThe defense of self-defense is statutorily codified in section 7 — 1 of the Criminal Code of 1961 (the Code), which provides, in relevant part:\\n“A person is justified in the use of force against another when and to the extent that he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself *** against such other’s imminent use of unlawful force. However, he is justified in the use of force which is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm only if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself ***.” (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 38, par. 7-1.)\\nSelf-defense as provided for under section 7 — 1 is an affirmative defense which, once raised, the State must disprove beyond a reasonable doubt. (People v. Estes (1984), 127 Ill. App. 3d 642, 651, 469 N.E.2d 275.) Moreover, the defense is raised by a slight amount of evidence. People v. Bratcher (1976), 63 Ill. 2d 534, 540, 349 N.E.2d 31; People v. Daily (1979), 79 Ill. App. 3d 928, 939, 398 N.E.2d 923.\\nPreliminarily, we believe that defendant’s testimony of the sequence of events preceding the fatal shooting of the victim adequately raised the issue of self-defense. Specifically, we note defendant’s testimony that he pulled his gun because he perceived Island standing with his arm in a striking position while holding a beer can or some other object, that Jeffries had said to Island, “Hit him, hit him,” and that he, defendant, was scared at this time. We believe that the facts and circumstances of this case adequately established, contrary to the dissent’s conclusions, that defendant could have subjectively believed that Island posed a threat to him and that he, therefore, adequately raised the issue of self-defense.',\n",

Rather, we believe that a defendant raises the defense where his testimony and any other evidence relevant thereto is sufficient to allow the trier of fact to infer whether he actually believed in the necessity to use the force he did. “So long as some evidence is presented from which a jury could conclude that defendant had a subjective belief [that the use of force was necessary], the jury should determine if the belief existed.” (Emphasis added.)

That requirement for raising, as opposed to proving, the defense was met here.\\nDefendant’s testimony that he was legally blind, which was unrebutted by the State, could also properly be considered by the jury in determining whether Island presented a threat to defendant. In People v. Estes (1984), 127 Ill. App. 3d 642, 651, 469 N.E.2d 275, the court noted, inter alia, that the test of self-defense claims is whether the facts and circumstances would induce a reasonable apprehension of serious bodily harm in light of the defendant’s perception of the situation at the time he employed force against his aggressor. The court then considered the fact that the defendant had extremely poor vision as a factor in determining whether the State had disproved her claim of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.

In the context of self-defense, it is the defendant’s perception of danger, not the actual danger, which is dis-positive. (People v. Sawyer (1986), 115 Ill. 2d 184, 193, 503 N.E.2d 331, cert. denied (1987), 482 U.S. 930, 96 L. Ed. 2d 702, 107 S. Ct. 3216.)

People v. Lockett (1980), 82 Ill. 2d 546, 553, 413 N.E.2d 378.\\nNext, we disagree with the State that defendant’s lack of an intent to shoot Island and his claim of accidental shooting precluded a claim of self-defense as a matter of law. (People v. Robinson (1987), 163 Ill. App. 3d 754, 516 N.E.2d 1292; People v. Whitelow (1987), 162 Ill. App. 3d 626, 515 N.E.2d 1327; People v. Brooks (1985), 130 Ill.

App. 3d 692, 430 N.E.2d 257, in conjunction with defendant’s claims of lack of intent and accident, as necessitating a conclusion that defendant’s claim of self-defense was disproved beyond a reasonable doubt. Chatman held that it is unreasonable for an armed defendant to believe that an unarmed victim who had turned his back and was walking away poses an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm so as to justify the use of force against him.

Estes (1984), 127 Ill. App. 3d 642, 651-52, 469 N.E.2d 275.) Rather, where it is clear that the aggressor is capable of inflicting serious bodily harm on the defendant without the use of a deadly weapon, and it appears that he intends to, then it is unnecessary for the aggressor to be armed for the defendant to employ deadly force in self-defense. Estes, 127 Ill. App. 3d 642, 469 N.E.2d 275.\\nThus, the facts that Island was not armed with a deadly weapon and was walking away when he was shot, and that defendant claimed the shooting was accidental, do not require the conclusion that defendant’s claim of self-defense was disproved beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, the State had the burden of adducing evidence to disprove defendant’s claim of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. This the State did not do. As such, we cannot say that defendant was proved guilty of the offense of murder beyond such a doubt.\\nThis conclusion brings us to defendant’s next contention on appeal. Relying on People v. Robinson (1987), 163 Ill. App. 3d 754, 516 N.E.2d 1292, defendant contends that the trial court erred in refusing tendered instructions on self-defense and voluntary manslaughter on the ground that defendant’s claim that he accidentally shot Island precluded him from asserting the affirmative defense of self-defense.',\n",

The trial court held that the defendant’s defense that the shooting was accidental precluded a claim of voluntary manslaughter and self-defense. In a thoroughly researched opinion, the Robinson court found that the trial court erred. The court first noted the split of authority over the propriety of self-defense instructions when a defendant testifies that a homicide or battery was accidental. The court noted that courts that rejected self-defense instructions, where the defendant claimed accident, did so partly on the basis of a conflict between the two defenses. However, the court found that in those cases no self-defense was actually shown on the facts, thus justifying no instruction thereon that could contradict an accident theory in the first place.

The decision date is (1989-06-14)\\n\\nThe court reasoned that the split of authority could be explained by differences among the cases as to whether the defendants claimed: (1) that all of their acts immediately preceding the injury at issue were accidental or nonforcible; or (2) that the acts preceding the injury inflicted were intentionally forcible and self-defensive but that the injury was accidental. The court termed cases of the first group cases of accident but no self-defense. In those cases, the defendants had not shown self-defense since intent or force prior to the injury was lacking. As such, instructions on that issue had been properly denied, regardless of any inconsistency with the defense of accident. The court termed cases of the second group as cases of self-defense plus accident. Those cases involved “intentional self-defense though unintended result.” Therein, intentional acts were the basis for self-defense theories and instructions, but only to support ultimate defenses of accident as to the injury for which the defendants were tried. In other words, the defendants in those cases relied on accident theories as to the injury inflicted and self-defense theories as to their acts preceding the injury. Robinson, 163 Ill. App. 3d at 762, 768.\\nThe crux of this case is thus in determining within which group this case falls. That is, did defendant’s evidence reveal intentional acts of self-defense immediately preceding an allegedly accidental injury or merely an allegedly accidental injury not preceded by any acts of self-defense? Stated differently, the issue here is whether defendant was engaged in intentionally self-defensive acts immediately prior to the shooting of Island, thus entitling him to have the jury instructed on self-defense. After considering the differences between the two groups of cases, as outlined in Robinson, we find that defendant’s evidence revealed intentional acts of self-defense and that he was thus entitled to have the jury instructed on that defense.',\n",

The decision date is (1989-06-14)\\n\\nThe Robinson court classified each of the cases the State relies upon here, and in which self-defense instructions were held properly refused, as cases of accident but no self-defense. It classified the cases defendant relies upon, in which such instructions were held properly given, as cases of self-defense plus accident.\\nSpecifically, the Robinson court found that in People v. Shelton (1985), 140 Ill. App. 3d 886, 489 N.E.2d 879, the defendant never affirmatively used force against anyone but merely, without intending to stab, extended a knife into which the victim ran. Thus, the Robinson court concluded that the Shelton defendant did not initiate any use of force constituting self-defense under the statutory definition of the term and entitling him to self-defense instructions.\\nIn People v. Purrazzo (1981), 95 Ill. App. 3d 886, 420 N.E.2d 461, cert, denied (1982), 455 U.S. 948, 71 L. Ed. 2d 661, 102 S. Ct. 1448, the defendant testified that: (1) he struggled with his wife when she pointed a gun at him; (2) during the struggle, one shot, which defendant did not think struck his -wife, was fired; (3) he got the gun from his wife; and (4) while he held it, his dog jumped at his arm, causing other shots to be fired. The Robinson court reasoned that, based on the Purrazzo defendant’s own testimony, when the shots which hit his wife were fired, any acts of self-defense had been completed since he then possessed the gun and his wife was sitting on the couch onto which he had pushed her. The court therefore concluded that the Purrazzo defendant was indeed relying on an accident theory and had failed to show that he was engaged in any intentional self-defensive acts when the shots, which indisputably hit his wife, were fired.',\n",

Dzambazovic (1978), 61 Ill. App. 3d 703, 377 N.E.2d 1077, the defendant testified that the victim produced a gun and threatened to kill him and herself if the defendant drove to meet her boyfriend; he struggled with the victim for the gun; the gun went off accidentally while the victim was holding it; he did not shoot her with an intent to kill her. The Robinson court said that no self-defense justifying an instruction thereon was shown in Dzambazovic. The court relied on the fact that the force threatened by the victim was not imminent, since it was conditioned upon the defendant’s driving to meet the victim’s boyfriend, and that the defendant did not testify that he initiated the struggle from a motive of self-defense.\\nThe State asserts that this case is indistinguishable from Shelton, Purrazzo, and Dzambazovic. Specifically, the State asserts that, as in those cases, there was no evidence of an intentional or justifiable use of force by defendant. In so arguing, the State relies upon defendant’s testimony that he had the gun because he was afraid of Island and wanted to frighten him, that Island had turned away from him, and that the gun discharged when his shoulder bumped against the mailboxes. That the defendant acted to protect himself, the State argues, was insufficient to raise the issue of self-defense in view of his lack of intent to harm the victim, citing People v. Tanthorey (1849), 404 Ill. 520, 89 N.E.2d 403.\\nWe believe that the State’s reliance on Tanthorey is misplaced. We further believe that its argument that defendant did not engage in an intentional use of force against Island, as required under section 7 — 1 for a self-defense instruction (People v. Whitelow (1987), 162 Ill. App. 3d 626, 515 N.E.2d 1327), is incorrect.',\n",

In classifying Tanthorey as a case of accident but no self-defense, the Robinson court reasoned that, according to his own testimony, the Tanthorey defendant never affirmatively used force against anyone, but merely raised his arm to ward off any force that might be directed at him. The court thus concluded that self-defense instructions had been properly refused in Tanthorey because self-defense, in terms of an affirmative use of force against someone, had not been shown.\\nHere, in contrast to Tanthorey and contrary to the State’s assertion, defendant’s act of pulling and pointing a gun at Island after perceiving that Island was holding a beer can or other object in a striking position was an affirmative and intentional use of force in defense of self.',\n",

Whitelow (1987), 162 Ill. App. 3d 626, 515 N.E.2d 1327, the defendant testified that Bobby Joe Capers and another, with whom he had been arguing, began advancing toward him; he became frightened because of prior beatings by Capers and his friends; he ran for something with which to defend himself while being chased; he grabbed an object from a fourth person without realizing it was a shotgun; the gun discharged as he grabbed it; and he did not intend to shoot or kill Capers. As in this case, the State defended the trial court’s refusal of self-defense instructions on the grounds that defendant’s defense was accident and he did not intend to shoot Capers. In rejecting the argument, the appellate court noted its holdings in two prior cases that self-defense instructions were appropriate although the defendants testified the deaths resulted from accidents. Of one of those cases, People v. Buchanan (1980), 91 Ill. App. 3d 13, 414 N.E.2d 262, which defendant cites and the Robinson court placed in the “self-defense plus accident” category, the court noted: “In Buchanan, the defendant alleged he pulled a handgun on the victim to protect himself. A struggle ensued, the gun fired, and the victim died.” Whitelow, 162 Ill. App. 3d at 629.\\nWhitelow and Buchanan are thus dispositive of the question whether defendant here engaged in an intentional act of force which supported instructing the jury on self-defense. That is, defendant’s act of pulling the gun, pointing it at Island and cocking the hammer was as much, if not more, an act of force as the acts of the Whitelow and Buchanan defendants.',\n",

App. 3d 754, 769, 516 N.E.2d 1292), we also find the State’s reliance on defendant’s lack of intent to shoot Island unavailing. In so arguing, the State misconstrues the intent necessary to support a self-defense instruction in cases of this type. As Robinson makes clear, that intent is an intent to use force in the defense of self. It is not an intent to cause or inflict the injury which leads to the criminal charge against the defendant.\\nThe State also attempts to distinguish People v. Stewart (1986), 143 Ill.

In view of our conclusion that defendant also intentionally used force to defend himself, we find the State’s argument unavailing.\\nThe State argues further that, unlike the Brooks defendant’s testimony that the victim had shot at him, the testimony of defendant here did not establish a need for self-defense. This argument ignores defendant’s testimony that Island was holding an object in a striking position before defendant pulled and pointed his gun at him. This testimony established defendant’s belief in a need to defend himself. Defendant’s testimony that Island turned away as he was stepping backwards and that the gun went off as he was so doing, upon which the State relies, did not negate the propriety of instructing the jury on self-defense.',\n",

Moreover, “[t]he evidence of self-defense immediately preceding the alleged accident distinguishes the instant case from others in which no such evidence had been offered and the refusal of a self-defense instruction was upheld.” (Emphasis added.)

Of the cases cited by the parties, Purrazzo is the most factually analogous to this case. However, like the Robinson court, we find it distinguishable from this case on the ground that the claimed self-defensive acts of the defendant therein did not immediately precede the injury for which he was tried.\\nBecause we disagree with the State that defendant did not establish that he was involved in self-defensive acts immediately preceding or at the time of Island’s shooting, we likewise find unavailing its attempt to distinguish Robinson and Buchanan from this case on that ground.',\n",

In neither of those cases, however, did the defendants claim that the injuries for which they were tried resulted from accident preceded by acts of self-defense, as in this case. As such, we find them inapposite here. In this case, defendant testified regarding a perceived need to defend himself. Even a slight amount of evidence raises the self-defense issue and justifies an instruction thereon. (People v. Robinson, 163 Ill. App. 3d 754, 761, 516 N.E.2d 1292.) As such, we cannot say that the refusal of such instructions here was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\\nIn sum, we believe that defendant sufficiently raised the defense of self-defense and that, contrary to the trial court’s belief, his claim that he shot Island accidentally did not preclude his right to have the jury instructed on that defense as a matter of law. This conclusion requires us to hold that defendant was also entitled to have the jury instructed on voluntary manslaughter.\\nSection 9 — 2(b) of the . Code provided at the time of the shooting, in relevant part:\\n“(b) A person who intentionally or knowingly kills an individual commits voluntary manslaughter if at the time of the killing he believes the circumstances to be such that, if they existed, would justify or exonerate the killing under the principles stated in [Ill.

App. 3d at 777.) The trial court’s failure to instruct the jury on self-defense and voluntary manslaughter requires a new trial.\\nFinally, because the State may desire to use defendant’s recorded statement at a new trial, we must address the contentions that the trial court erred in failing to suppress that statement and that the State violated defendant’s fifth amendment right to remain silent by using the statement to impeach him.\\nAs the basis of the first contention, defendant asserts that the State’s failure to record all of his statements to the police denied him State and Federal due process. The only case directly supporting defendant’s position is Stephan v. Alaska (Alaska 1985), 711 P.2d 1156.

As the Vermont Supreme Court reasoned in declining to interpret the due process clause of the Vermont Constitution in accord with Stephan, the most appropriate means of augmenting the due process rights of citizens, especially in view of the ramifications of the rule urged by defendant, is through legislation.

In Robinson, the defendant expressly invoked his “rights” in refusing to tell the police why he shot the deceased. Robinson, 44 Ill.

The decision date is (1968-09-24)\\n\\nMr. Justice Underwood\\ndelivered the opinion of the court :\\nOn November 3, 1965, Leon Smith was found guilty of armed robbery by a Cook County jury and sentenced to a term of four to eight years imprisonment following a trial in which he was represented by privately retained counsel. On April 27, 1967, Smith filed a pro se post-conviction petition, and the public defender was appointed to represent him.\\nWe agree that the petition was properly dismissed because it failed, to allege facts showing a substantial denial of Smith’s constitutional rights. (See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1967, chap. 38, par. 122—1.) Petitioner alleged (1) that “the identification of the defendant was without doubt too vague”, (2) that “the trial was merely perfunctory and did not afford the defendant a fair and impartial hearing”, (3) that “much was made of the fact that no witnesses appeared to testify in behalf of the defendant, thus creating in the eyes of the jury that defendant was making no effort to prove his innocence”, (4) that he was not granted “ethical fairness”, (5) that it was not incumbent upon defendant to prove himself innocent.',\n",

The decision date is (1968-09-24)\\n\\nEven when the allegations of the petition are “liberally construed in favor of the petitioner” they fail to show “imprisonment in violation of the Federal or State constitution.” (People v. Bernatowicz, 413 Ill. 181, 185; People v. Jennings, 411 Ill. 21, 26.) The errors claimed in the post-conviction petition are stated in a vague and conclusionary manner completely devoid of any factual evidence or supporting affidavits to substantiate the general allegations. Such nonfactual and nonspecific assertions which merely amount to conclusions are not sufficient to require a post-conviction hearing (People v. Satterwhite, 38 Ill.2d 138, 140; People v. Evans, 37 Ill.2d 27, 30; People v. Ashley, 34 Ill.2d 402), and the failure to attach supporting affidavits to the petition or adequately explain their absence permits the dismissal of the post-conviction proceeding where the petitioner’s allegations are not “substantially borne out by matters appearing on the face of the record.” (People v. Reeves, 412 Ill. 555, 559; Ill. Rev. Stat. 1967, chap. 38, par. 122—2.) Since petitioner has failed to make a substantial showing of any violation of his constitutional rights, the dismissal by the trial court was proper. People v. Ashley, 34 Ill.2d 402, 410; People v. Reeves, 412 Ill. 555, 560.\\nWhile appellate counsel asserts defendant’s representation in the post-conviction hearing was inadequate in that leave to amend the petition should have been sought, no motion for leave to amend was there made nor does there appear any reason to believe the petition could have been successfully amended.

The instruction assumes to state the doctrine in regard to verbal admissions, and the error consists in the omission to state an important qualification which, we think, has its foundation in reason and authority, viz: where the admission is deliberately and understandingly made, and precisely identified, the evidence it affords is. often of the most satisfactory nature.

The prayer for an injunction was necessary, to prevent the execution of a deed under the decree upon the cross-bill, until the court determined as to the vacation of the decree.\\nThe purpose of the bill, evidently, was to obtain relief, under section 18 of the chancery code (Eev. Stat. 1845, 95).\\nThat section should not be construed as applicable only to causes in which an interlocutory decree has been entered. It provides that, if an answer is not filed at the return term, the bill may be taken for confessed; but that the court may extend the time for answer, and, in such case, enter an interlocutory decree. This can only be upon request, and for good cause shown; otherwise, the decree is pro confesso:\\nThe last clause of the section is general in its language and application, that the court may, upon offer and a showing of sufficient cause, at the second term permit an answer and vacate the decree. If the interlocutory decree be entered, the defendant then has until some time in vacation or until the next term, according to the order, to file an answer, without any further permission of the court. In such case, the court exercises its discretion at the return term. The latter clause of the section can have no application to such circumstances, for it provides that the court may grant permission to file an answer at the second term.\\nThe plain reading of the section is that, at the first term, if the bill be not taken for confessed, the court may exercise a discretion and extend the time for answer, and enter the interlocutory decree; and if the bill be taken for confessed, permission may be given to answer at the subsequent term.\\nThis case is within the last clause of the section. There was sufficient cause shown to induce the exercise of the discretion of the court, and the decree is affirmed.\\nDecree affirmed.',\n",

The decision date is (1894-10-30)\\n\\nMr. Justice Craig\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nThis was an indictment in the circuit court of Hardin county, against Charity Eller, alias Charity Brown, for arson. On a trial the jury found the defendant guilty, and fixed her term of imprisonment at one year in the penitentiary. The court overruled a motion for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, and entered judgment on the verdict. To reverse the judgment the defendant sued out this writ of error.\\nOn the trial the People relied mainly on the testimony of one William Brown and Docia Cullom (or Docia Cogdill) to prove the defendant guilty of the crime charged in the indictment, and if these witnesses testified to the truth, there was evidence before the jury sufficient to authorize a conviction. But, as respects the witness Brown, it appears from his own admissions while a witness on the stand, that he had served a term of imprisonment in the penitentiary of Indiana, had been convicted of larceny in Hardin county, and when asked how many times he had been charged with burglary and larceny in Hardin county, answered, “all my life.” Moreover, a large number of reputable citizens testified that they knew his general reputation for truth and veracity in the neighborhood where he resided, that it was bad, and they would not believe him under oath, and his reputation for truth and veracity was sustained by no witness. Under the evidence the witness was so completely impeached that no credit should have been given his evidence by an intelligent jury. As to the other witness, Docia Cullom, it was proven that she made so many statements out of court different from her evidence in court, on material matters, that but little credit could properly be attached to her evidence.',\n",

At the request of the People the court gave a large number of instructions. Among others, the court gave Nos. 17, 20 and 22, as follows :\\n17. “The jury are instructed, that in determining the weight to be given to the testimony of the defendant in this case, the jury are authorized to consider the relationship of the witnesses to the defendant, if the same is proven; their interest, if any, in the event of the suit; their temper, feeling or fears, if any has been shown ; their demeanor while testifying ; their apparent intelligence and their means of information; and to give such credit to the testimony of each witness as, under all the circumstances, such witness seems to be entitled to.”\\n20. “The prosecution does not have to prove that the defendant had no permission or authority to burn the said house. If the defendant relies on authority from the owner to so burn said house mentioned in said indictment, it is her duty to show and prove the same.”\\n22. “You should further take into consideration facts and circumstances proven by the evidence, as explained in these instructions, such as declarations, threats, efforts to conceal articles of bed clothing, pillow shams and oil cans, dresses, efforts to change the lining on facing of dresses. All of such facts have been so proven. Fear of being arrested, (if you believe, from the evidence aforesaid, she did then and there fear she would be arrested,) and take into consideration all such facts and circumstances as, in connection with all other facts and circumstances shown on trial, surrounding the case, in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.”',\n",

The decision date is (1978-06-06)\\n\\nMr. JUSTICE GUILD\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nThis is an appeal from the order of the trial court dismissing plaintiff s complaint for lack of diligence in serving the defendants, pursuant to the provisions of Supreme Court Rule 103(b) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1975, ch. 110A, par. 103(b)).\\nThe plaintiff was injured at Copley Hospital on June 7, 1973. She was treated by Dr. Marks on or about that date. Subsequently Dr. Miller examined her, took X-rays and told her to go back to work on October 16, 1973. Plaintiff, in her brief, alleges that she discovered the basis for her malpractice action either on November 8,1973, when a Dr. Bachman told her she had an old compression fracture, or in April 1974, when she obtained the medical records of Dr. Marks.\\nPlaintiff, after filing the complaint on May 28, 1975, failed to have summons issued. It was not until 10 months later when plaintiff s counsel was notified, on March 12,1976, that the cause would be dismissed under the local no progress court rule 4.2 on March 18, 1976, that counsel obtained summons for the first time. Summons were served shortly thereafter. On September 3,1976, the trial court dismissed this cause as to all three defendants under the provisions of Supreme Court Rule 103(b). No issue was presented, nor did the court at that time rule on whether the complaint itself had been filed within the time limitations of the pertinent provisions of the statute of limitations (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1973, ch. 83, par. 22.1).\\nThe issue before us is whether the plaintiff acted with reasonable diligence to obtain service on the defendants within the meaning of Supreme Court Rule 103(b) and whether the trial court abused its discretion in holding that defendant did not show reasonable diligence and in dismissing the complaint.',\n",

The decision date is (1978-06-06)\\n\\nSome confusion may have been generated in the mind of counsel for plaintiff as to the issue now before us, by the actions of two of the three defendants in the trial court. Counsel for Dr. Miller did not at first raise the issue of dismissal under Rule 103(b) but, on April 30, 1976, filed his answer to the complaint. Counsel for Copley Hospital, using the wrong date as to the filing of the complaint, moved to dismiss for failure to file within the two-year statute of limitations. This motion was properly denied by the trial court and Copley Hospital then filed its answer to the complaint. Only the law firm of Roger K. O’Reilly, upon the service of summons upon their client Dr. Marks, 10 months after the filing of the law suit, moved the court to dismiss the complaint for lack of diligence under the provisions of Rule 103(b). Finally, counsel for Copley Hospital and counsel for Dr. Miller, the following September, moved for dismissal under Rule 103(b) — adopting the motion of defendant Marks filed some five months earlier.\\nCounsel for the plaintiff raises the issue of the statute of limitations having been complied with, using the date of the discovery of the injury. As a direct result of the decision in Mosby v. Michael Reese Hospital (1964), 49 Ill. App. 2d 336, 199 N.E.2d 633, the legislature amended the provisions of section 21 of that act by the addition of section 21.1, providing that the cause of action in a medical malpractice action arises or accrues when the party discovers or “knew or should have known” of the injury. We are fully aware of the “discovery rule” as it is applied to medical malpractice.\\n«» « « in medical malpractice cases as this, the cause of action accrues when the person injured learns of his injury or should reasonably have learned of it.” (Lipsey v.

App. 3d 229, 366 N.E.2d 930.\\nHowever, the question of the applicability of the statute of limitations, as mentioned above, is not before this court. As we have stated, the question is whether this case was properly dismissed under Supreme Court Rule 103(b), which provides:\\n“(b) Dismissal for Lack of Diligence. If the plaintiff fails to exercise reasonable diligence to obtain service prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, the action as a whole or as to any unserved defendant may be dismissed without prejudice. If the failure to exercise reasonable diligence to obtain service occurs after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, the dismissal shall be with prejudice. In either case the dismissal may be made on the application of any defendant or on the court’s own motion.” Ill. Rev. Stat. 1975, ch. 110A, par. 103(b).',\n",

The decision date is (1978-06-06)\\n\\nThere are numerous cases construing this rule, a few of which we will mention, but in no case have we been able to find a situation comparable to that before us. Here we have a complainant filing a law suit and not taking out, or seeking, service of summons on the defendants named therein, until 10 months later when the court advised her that the cause was going to be dismissed because of lack of progress. Counsel’s excuse for not taking out summons is that she did not know the extent of plaintiff’s injuries until April 1974. The complaint was filed May 28,1975, over a year after the discovery of the alleged malpractice. The burden is upon the plaintiff to demonstrate that she has acted with reasonable diligence to obtain service. As the court aptly observed in Phifer v. Hayes (1974), 20 Ill. App. 3d 635, 314 N.E.2d 473, Rule 103(b) was intended to prevent the practice whereby a plaintiff could effectively circumvent the statute of limitations by filing suit and delaying or failing to have summons issued. (See also Kohlhaas v. Morse (1962), 36 Ill. App. 2d 158, 183 N.E.2d 16; Karpiel v. LaSalle National Bank (1970), 119 Ill. App. 2d 157, 255 N.E.2d 61.) The most recent case on the issue of reasonable diligence is found in Montero v. University of Illinois Hospital (1978), 57 Ill. App. 3d 206, 372 N.E.2d 1010. The court, after observing that each case must be considered on its own facts and circumstances, found that the plaintiff there had failed to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining service. Unlike the case before us, in Montero the plaintiff had taken out the original and three alias summons and the doctors had moved to another State. As to the whereabouts of the defendants in the instant case, the record shows that the two doctors were at the same address from the date of the injury to the date of the service of summons. Plaintiff herein did not have summons issue at the filing and only did so when the case was about to be dismissed.',\n",

After his election he maintained his position with the Chicago police department until February 1985, at which time he requested a leave of absence from active duty. He made the request allegedly because he was ordered to do so by his commanding officer since police department policy did not allow him to continue on active duty while serving as a State senator. After complying with this rule, plaintiff allegedly became aware of other employees of the City of Chicago who had been elected to the General Assembly, but who were allowed to maintain their city employment while serving their elected office.

The decision date is (1990-11-16)\\n\\nOur consideration of this appeal must begin with a discussion of Public Act 84 — 1018 and the Illinois Supreme Court case, Dineen v. City of Chicago (1988), 125 Ill. 2d 248, 531 N.E.2d 347. In Dineen two Chicago police officers and Lodge 7 of the Fraternal Order of Police (the bargaining unit for Chicago police officers below the rank of sergeant) brought an action challenging the Chicago police department rule that its officers take unpaid leaves of absence upon becoming candidates for public office. It was contended that the leave-of-absence policy for police officers running for political office was invalidated by Public Act 84 — 1018.\\nAs noted in Dineen, Public Act 84 — 1018, which took effect on October 30, 1985, amended article 10, divisions 1 and 2.1, of the Illinois Municipal Code (herein referred to as the Code) (see 111. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 24, pars. 10—1—27.1, 10—2.1—5.1) and the Fire Protection District Act (see Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 127½, par. 37.16a) by adding provisions which prohibit the entities governed by those statutes from restricting the political activities of their employees. Public Act 84— 1018 also contained a preemption provision declaring that any existing laws or ordinances of home rule units of government \"inconsistent with this Act are hereby superseded.”\\nIn Dineen the theory set forth by the plaintiffs at trial was that the preemption provision of Public Act 84 — 1018 applied not only to those municipalities covered under article. 10, divisions 1 or 2.1, and the fire protection districts, but to all home rule units and, thus, to the City of Chicago. The appellate court reversed the trial court’s finding in favor of the plaintiffs, ruling that Public Act 84 — 1018 affected only municipalities covered under division 1 or division 2.1 of article 10 of the Code and that the City of Chicago did not operate under these provisions.',\n",

The supreme court sustained the appellate court’s decision, affirming the ruling that Public Act 84 — 1018 applied only to those municipalities covered under division 1 or 2.1 of the Code. However, the court refused to consider whether the City of Chicago was such a municipality, finding that this issue had been waived by the plaintiffs because of their failure to raise it at the trial level or in their petition for leave to appeal to the supreme court.\\nIt is important to note, however, that the court in Dineen specifically acknowledged the viability of the issue by its statement:\\n“Clearly, we have the authority to consider the plaintiffs’ new argument.

The decision date is (1990-11-16)\\n\\nThe plaintiff in the present case raised at trial the issue of whether the City of Chicago, at least with respect to its police department, is covered under division 1 of the Code and, as such, prohibited by Public Act 84 — 1018 from enforcing any rules or regulations, such as the leave-of-absence policy, that restrict the political activity of its employees. Consequently, this case goes beyond Dineen and the trial court erred when it held that Dineen was dispositive on the issue of whether a violation of the public act occurred. We, therefore, must now consider whether the City of Chicago is a municipality covered under article 10, division 1, of the Illinois Municipal Code and, if so, whether the leave-of-absence policy involved here violates Public Act 84-1018.\\nIn 1976 the City of Chicago enacted a personnel ordinance, superseding the civil service system set forth in article 10, division 1, of the Illinois Municipal Code. (See Chicago Municipal Code §25.1 — 1 (1976).) However, two provisions of the Code, section 10 — 1—18.1 and section 10 — 1—45, were expressly retained. It is plaintiff’s position that the retention of these two provisions signified the City’s adoption of article 10, division 1, for the purposes of the its police employees and, therefore, the City must be subject to the prohibitions of section 10— 1 — 27.1 with regard to regulations affecting its police personnel. We disagree.\\nIt has previously been held that the City of Chicago, by enacting a separate personnel ordinance to replace the civil service system set forth in the Illinois Municipal Code, was not a municipality pperating under article 10, division 1, of the Illinois Municipal Code. (Dineen v. City of Chicago (1987), 152 Ill. App. 3d 90, 93, 504 N.E.2d 144; Reaman v. Personnel Board (1981), 96 Ill. App. 3d 919, 422 N.E.2d 120.) In addition, the court in Resman stated:',\n",

App. 3d at 922.\\nWe concur with the conclusions of these courts and find that the City of Chicago is a home rule unit which does not operate under article 10, division 1, of the Illinois Municipal Code. Article 10, division 1, of the Code is an optional provision. (Dineen, 152 Ill. App. 3d at 93; Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 24, par. 10—1—43.) By enacting its own personnel code, the City of Chicago clearly exercised its power to remove itself from the operation of division 1.\\nFurthermore, we find no validity to plaintiff’s argument that the retention of the two State code provisions somehow exempts police officers from the public employment system established in the municipal code of Chicago or places the Chicago police department under the mandates of article 10, division 1, of the Code. The only significance we attach to the retention of the provisions of the Illinois Municipal Code is the city’s intention to maintain review of police board decisions under the Administrative Review Law. Consequently, we find that the City of Chicago is not subject to the prohibitions of section 10 — 1—27.1 of the State municipal code or the preemption provision of the amendatory act. It follows that the leave of absence complained of here does not violate the statutory provisions of Public Act 84 — 1018 and, therefore, is not unlawful or wrongful.

A valid claim for retaliatory discharge must contain allegations that (1) plaintiff was discharged, (2) the discharge was in retaliation for plaintiff’s activities, and (3) the discharge violates a clear mandate of public policy. (Hinthorn v. Roland’s of Bloomington, Inc. (1988), 119 Ill. 2d 526, 529, 519 N.E.2d 909.) In the present case plaintiff does not allege that he was discharged, but that he was “constructively discharged,” i.e., that he was compelled to relinquish his position as a police officer because of his political activity.\\nWe note, however, that plaintiff’s complaint belies this charge. In paragraph 18 of count II of plaintiff’s third-amended complaint it states:\\n“On January 27, 1986, Plaintiff resigned from his position in the Department of Police in order to transfer pension credits to the General Assembly Retirement System because he could not receive a normal 20 year pension credit from the Department of Police since the superintendent of police had advised him he would have to resign from his position as State Senator in order to return to the Department of Police. Given the superintendent’s position regarding the leave of absence policy, the only way Plaintiff could receive pension credit for his past service as a police officer was to transfer the credits into the General Assembly Retirement System, which required Plaintiff’s resignation from the Department of Police.”\\nWe conclude from these facts, as did the trial court, that plaintiff was not discharged, but rather, resigned voluntarily from his position with the Chicago police department in order to take advantage of certain benefits made available to him by newly enacted legislation.',\n",

Plaintiff suggests that these conditions sufficiently allege a “constructive discharge,” which meets the requirements of discharge for the tort of retaliatory discharge. Plaintiff’s claim must fail for two reasons. First, the concept of constructive discharge has been rejected in the context of retaliatory discharge cases, having been found to be outside the narrow parameters of that cause of action. (Scheller v. Health Care Service Corp. (1985), 138 Ill. App. 3d 219, 223-25, 485 N.E.2d 26.) Secondly, even if the concept of constructive discharge were recognized in Illinois within the context of a common-law tort of retaliatory discharge, plaintiff failed to set forth facts to establish a constructive discharge.',\n",

The decision date is (1990-11-16)\\n\\nIn other causes of action where the concept of constructive discharge has been recognized (e.g., employment discrimination cases brought under State or Federal statutes), it has been construed as requiring a showing that the employer deliberately or intentionally made the employee’s working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign to escape the intolerable conditions. (See Burnell v. General Telephone Co. of Illinois, Inc. (1989), 181 Ill. App. 3d 533, 537, 536 N.E.2d 1387; Steele v. Human Rights Comm’n (1987), 160 Ill. App. 3d 577, 581, 513 N.E.2d 1177.) In the present case plaintiff did not set forth any facts to indicate an intolerable working condition. While plaintiff’s decision to resign may have been motivated, wholly or in part, by the leave-of-absence policy practiced by the police department, there is no basis for finding that this regulation is unlawful or in any sense wrongful. Therefore, at best plaintiff showed that he made a reasoned decision to relinquish his position with the police department after weighing all his options. This does -not establish a constructive discharge. See the Burnell and Steele cases cited above.\\nPlaintiff next argues that his right to equal protection under the State and Federal Constitutions was violated, and as support for his claim he names a number, of legislators who have apparently continued their city employment while serving their terms of office. However, we find these facts wholly insufficient to set forth a claim that plaintiff’s right to equal protection of the law has been denied.',\n",

Hughes (1944), 321 U.S. 1, 8, 88 L. Ed. 497, 503, 64 S. Ct. 397, 401.) In the present case plaintiff’s third-amended complaint only charged that certain other legislators were allowed to maintain their city employment while serving in their elected office, although he was, denied this opportunity. Plaintiff does not establish that he and these other legislators were, in fact, similarly situated so that he was entitled to be treated in the same manner. More importantly, the complaint contains no allegation of purposeful discrimination, i.e., the preferential and arbitrary denial of a right, benefit, or privilege to a person or class of persons without a reasonable basis. (See Wilson v. All-Steel, Inc. (1981), 87 Ill. 2d 28, 428 N.E.2d 489.) For example, plaintiff does not allege that only Republicans were denied the right to serve in the legislature and continue in their city employment or other such invidious bias. Consequently, we find no basis for plaintiff’s equal protection claim.',\n",

The gravamen of the action is, that the appellant charged the appellee with having been guilty of the crime of larceny. The appellant pleaded justification, and a trial was had which resulted in a verdict for the appellee. A host of witnesses were examined on the trial, whose testimony is preserved in the record,, perhaps twice as many as were necessary to elucidate the case. It was eminently a case for the consideration of a jury, and we do not propose to enter upon a critical analysis of the evidence, the sufficiency of which, to sustain the finding of the jury, is questioned by the assignment of errors. Had the jury been properly instructed, we doubt not that under the established rule we should be compelled to regard the verdict as settling the controverted facts in the case. .\\nThe evidence is very conflicting, and the character of many of the witnesses for truth and veracity was assailed by direct testimony, and in such a case we can not undertake to say what testimony the jury should believe, and what they should disregard.',\n",

The general rule is, that if the instructions are objectionable, and the natural effect would be to mislead the jury where the facts are controverted, the verdict will be set aside and the cause submitted to another jury, with proper directions. We think the series of instructions given for the appellee, taken as a whole, was objectionable, and tended rather to confuse than enlighten the minds of the jury.\\nThe 2d and 14th instructions are obnoxious to the same objections. By the 14th instruction, the jury were correctly told in the beginning, that evidence of character is admissible in actions of slander, for the purpose of showing the extent af the injury, but not in justification, and in conclusion they were told that if “ Adams has failed to prove Smith guilty of the crime charged, then the jury are bound, and the law makes it their duty, no matter what the evidence may be of the general character of Smith, to find for the plaintiff, Smith, in any sum not exceeding $5000.” The conclusion to the 2d instruction is the same in regard to the amount of damages.\\nThere was evidence offered, to say the least of it, tending to impeach the character of the appellee for integrity, and we can see how the 14th instruction, in its application to the facts, would mislead the jury.',\n",

This is stating the rule too broadly. It is undoubtedly true, that the character of a party, however bad, does not justify the utterance of slanderous words, but the measure of damages is vastly different where the party sustains a good character. In this instance, the jury were .plainly told, that no matter what may be the evidence of the character of the appellee, still he would be entitled to recover, even to the extent of $5000. In view of the evidence, we think that this instruction was clearly erroneous in its application to the facts. There was evidence of character, that the jury could not disregard, that would reduce the damages to a sum far below that amount, even if the words spoken were untrue.\\nIt is no answer to this view of the case, to say, that the jury did not award the full amount of $5000 as damages. It is not possible for us to know what influence the instruction did have upon the minds of the jury, to produce the verdict they found. It doubtless did have its effect in producing the verdict.\\nBoth instructions, the 2d and 14th, are liable to the just criticism, that they convey the idea to the mind that, under the facts in the case, the sum of $5000 would not be too high a verdict, in the judgment of the court.\\nThe 18th instruction is still more objectionable. By it the jury were told that in fixing the amount of damages they should take into consideration the “mental suffering” of the plaintiff, from the utterance of the slanderous words. The objection is, not that the jury might consider mental suffering as an element of damages, but that the instruction, by its terms, assumes the existence of that fact.',\n",

Plaintiff appeals from the order setting off the judgments, raising as issues whether: (1) a set-off constitutes a “modification” of an arbitrator’s award within the meaning of the Uniform Arbitration Act (Act) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 10, pars. 101 through 123); and (2) attorney fees should be exempted from a set-off where the arbitrator’s award does not expressly provide for such fees.\\nOn October 5, 1979, plaintiff general contractor initiated the instant action for foreclosure of a mechanic’s lien. Pursuant to the terms of the construction contract to which plaintiff and defendant were parties, the circuit court referred the matter to arbitration on February 26, 1980. In arbitration, in addition to the matters raised in plaintiff’s complaint, defendant submitted a demand for arbitration of its claim brought under the liquidated damages clause of the contract. After hearings, the arbitrator on May 18, 1983, issued awards requiring plaintiff to pay defendant $26,585.79 and defendant to pay plaintiff $27,655.10.\\nOn August 1, 1983, the court found that it had no jurisdiction to grant a set-off with respect to the arbitrator’s award. On August 11, 1983, the court entered a judgment for $26,585.79 in favor of defendant and a separate judgment for $27,655.10 in favor of plaintiff, nunc pro tunc as of August 1, 1983.

The decision date is (1985-07-23)\\n\\nSection 14 of the Act provides that “[u]pon the granting of an order confirming, modifying or correcting an award, judgment shall be entered in conformity therewith and be enforced as any other judgment.” (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 10, par. 114.) As defendant correctly notes, the arbitrator, whose role is limited to making findings, has no power to implement his decisions. Such power is reserved for the court, which here implemented the arbitrator’s decision by confirming the awards and ordering the set-off. The amounts awarded to each of the parties by the arbitrator were not disturbed and were therefore confirmed; the set-off, applying these same amounts, was “in conformity” with the order confirming the award. No substantive rights of the parties were affected by this procedure. (See Wilcox Co. v. Bouramas (1979), 73 Ill. App. 3d 1046, 1050, 392 N.E.2d 198.) Moreover, the court’s ordering of the set-off derives from the court’s inherent and statutory authority over the enforcement of its judgments. (Matson v. Oberne (1887), 25 Ill. App. 213, 216; Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 110, par. 12 — 176. See 49 C.J.S. Judgments sec. 566(b) (1947).) Applied to the precise amounts awarded by the arbitrator, the set-off thus comports with section 14, which permits judgments entered on arbitral awards to be “enforced as any other judgment.” Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 10, par. 114.\\nAn analogous case supports the circuit court’s action here. In S.J. Groves & Sons Co. v. Consolidated Construction Co. (1964), 51 Ill. App. 2d 246, 201 N.E.2d 183, the circuit court, in an action to confirm an arbitrator’s award, properly adjudicated the account between the parties by ordering the sum awarded to defendant by the arbitrator to be deducted from the larger sum owed to plaintiff by defendant; the appellate court there rejected defendant’s argument that plaintiff was limited only to confirmation of its award. Similarly, the circuit court here did not err by ordering the set-off.\\nII',\n",

(Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 110, pars. 12-176 and 12-177.) Under section 12 — 178(5) of the Code, set-offs are not permitted “as to so much of the first judgment as is due to the attorney in that action for his or her fees and disbursements therein.” (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 110, par. 12 — 178(5).) The purpose of exempting attorney fees from the set-off provision is to render the attorney claim for fees preferred as against his client’s judgment creditors. Silverman v. City Engineering Construction Co. (1930), 338 Ill. 154, 157, 170 N.E. 250; Siegel v. Meyer (1943), 319 Ill. App. 102, 105, 48 N.E.2d 595; Brent v. Brent (1887), 24 Ill. App. 448, 453.\\nPlaintiff urges that the instant set-off was erroneous in that the award assigned to it by the arbitrator presumptively included attorney fees. Because the arbitrator’s decision did not specify whether fees or costs were included in plaintiff’s award, plaintiff argues, the award of a gross sum of money is presumed to be a complete adjustment of all the matters arbitrated, citing Stearns v. Cope (1884), 109 Ill. 340, 348, and City State Bank v. Detrick (1925), 236 Ill. App. 350, 359-60.

It cannot be said that these findings were erroneous. There is no indication that the matter of fees was actually raised at the arbitration hearing, or that plaintiff asked for the hearing to be reopened after the arbitrator announced his decision. Moreover, neither of the cases relied upon by plaintiff to support the proposition that a gross award of money presumptively includes all matters arbitrated involved requests for fees and costs. (See Stearns v. Cope (1884), 109 Ill. 340; City State Bank v. Detrick (1925), 236 Ill. App. 350.) Here, the record does not support plaintiff’s argument that the matter of fees and costs was actually or presumptively arbitrated.\\nFinally, as the circuit court found, the amount of the fee award was a question for the arbitrator to address, not the court. As section 12 — 178 exempts from set-off only that portion of an arbitrator’s award designated for fees and costs, acceptance of plaintiff’s argument that unspecified fees and costs were presumptively included in its award would require exemption of the entire award. This would frustrate the equitable purposes of the set-off procedure' and would mean that if plaintiff were insolvent, it would be able to collect its judgment against defendant while defendant would be without remedy against plaintiff.

The decision date is (1998-08-10)\\n\\nJUSTICE CHAPMAN\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nThe defendant, Larry Lavallier, was convicted by a jury of two counts of aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol (aggravated driving) (625 ILCS 5/11 — 501(d)(1)(C), (d)(2) (West 1994)). Each conviction involved a separate victim. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of six years’ imprisonment and to pay restitution for medical expenses of $55,818.97 to John Pruett and $15,093.70 to Kalisa Brewer. On appeal, defendant contends that (1) one of the convictions for aggravated driving should be vacated as there was only one act of driving, (2) the restitution order is not authorized by statute and, therefore, the restitution portion of the judgment order is void, and (3) the amendments to the Unified Code of Corrections (730 ILCS 5/3 — 6—3(a)(2)(ii) (West Supp. 1995)) are void because the amendments were part of an act by the General Assembly, Public Act 89— 404 (Pub. Act 89 — 404, § 40, eff. August 20, 1995), which violated the single-subject rule of article I\\\\( section 8(d), of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. IV, § 8(d)).\\nDefendant first contends that as more than one offense may not be carved from the same physical act, one of the convictions must be vacated. See People v. King, 66 Ill. 2d 551, 566, 363 N.E.2d 838, 851 (1977). He argues that his single act in this instance was driving the automobile which caused injury to Pruett and Brewer. The State has confessed error. This court is not bound by the State’s confession of error. See People v. Kelly, 66 Ill. App. 2d 204, 209, 214 N.E.2d 290, 293 (1965). In the case at bar, two counts of aggravated driving arose because of separate injuries to two different people. Separate victims therefore require separate convictions and sentences. See People v. Davis, 105 Ill. App. 3d 129, 135, 434 N.E.2d 13, 17 (1982).',\n",

Grover, 93 Ill. App. 3d 877, 417 N.E.2d 1093 (1981), the defendant was convicted of reckless homicide and three counts of reckless conduct arising from an automobile collision. The majority of the panel members on the reviewing court rejected the defendant’s argument that since the death and injuries resulted from his single act of driving, the reckless conduct conviction must be vacated. The court noted that a distinction existed between cases where multiple offenses were committed against single victims and those where single acts were directed against multiple victims. In finding that the defendant was properly convicted of all four offenses, it noted that the reckless homicide offense and each of the three reckless conduct offenses required proof of facts that the others did not: that injury occurred to separate persons and their identity. Grover, 93 Ill. App. 3d at 882-83, 417 N.E.2d at 1098; see also People v. Davis, 105 Ill. App. 3d 129, 135, 434 N.E.2d 13, 17 (1982); People v. Washington, 53 Ill.

Section 11 — 501(a)(1) of the Illinois Vehicle Code makes the offense of driving with a blood-alcohol level at or above 0.08 a separate statutory offense from driving under the influence of alcohol, as stated in section 11 — 501(a)(2) of the Illinois Vehicle Code. 625 ILCS 5/11 — 501(a)(1), (a)(2) (West Supp. 1997); see Nelson, 210 Ill. App. 3d at 983, 569 N.E.2d at 1201. The Nelson court held that a defendant cannot be convicted of two driving under the influence charges where the offenses are based on the same physical act. Nelson, 210 Ill. App. 3d at 983, 569 N.E.2d at 1201. Nelson is distinguishable from the case at bar as there were not multiple victims in Nelson.\\nIn People v. McHugh, 121 Ill. App. 3d 825, 460 N.E.2d 18 (1984), the defendant was convicted of two counts of reckless homicide. This court vacated one count; however, in McHugh, there was only one victim.\\nThis court is aware of our supreme court’s opinion in People v. Cole, 172 Ill. 2d 85, 665 N.E.2d 1275 (1996), in which our supreme court construed the home invasion statute as providing for only one conviction based on one entry regardless of the number of occupants. Cole, 172 Ill. 2d at 102, 665 N.E.2d at 1283. Section 12 — 11 of the Criminal Code of 1961, the home invasion statute, speaks of a defendant’s entry into, or presence in, a dwelling when the defendant knows or has reason to know “that one or more persons is present” and, further, of the defendant’s use or threat of force while armed “upon any person or persons” in the dwelling, and of the defendant’s intentional injury of “any person or persons” in the dwelling. 720 ILCS 5/12 — 11 (West 1996).

Section 5 — 5—6(f) of the Unified Code of Corrections provides, in pertinent part:\\n“Taking into consideration the ability of the defendant to pay, the court shall determine whether restitution shall be paid in a single payment or in installments ***.” 730 ILCS 5/5 — 5—6(f) (West 1994).\\nThe trial court’s failure to define a specific payment schedule is understandable, given that defendant had yet to serve his term and there were questions about the regularity and amount of his future income. See People v. Brooks, 158 Ill. 2d 260, 272, 633 N.E.2d 692, 697 (1994). This court concludes that the portion of the judgment which required defendant to pay restitution was not void.\\nFinally, defendant contends that the truth-in-sentencing amendments to the Unified Code of Corrections are void because those amendments were part of Public Act 89 — 404 and that public act violates the single-subject rule of the Illinois Constitution. In sentencing defendant, the court said that under the amendments it was to state approximately how long defendant would be incarcerated. The court went on to state that defendant was eligible to receive day-for-day good-conduct credit and probably would serve three years’ imprisonment. Section 3 — 6—3(a)(2)(ii) of the Unified Code of Corrections, which requires certain defendants to serve 85% of their sentences, provides:\\n“(2) The rules and regulations on early release shall provide, with respect to offenses committed on or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1995, the following:\\n* * *',\n",

Pursuant to plaintiff’s complaint, the circuit court of Peoria County ordered defendant to render a formal accounting to plaintiff, and on June 30, 1980, a court-appointed receiver wound up the partnership affairs. A final judgment was entered, in February 1981, for plaintiff in the amount of $122,690 and costs. Defendant appealed, plaintiff cross-appealed, and the appellate court reversed (103 Ill. App. 3d 445). We allowed plaintiff’s petition for leave to appeal.\\nIn 1941, plaintiff, defendant, and their brother Peter Couri orally agreed to operate as equal partners the “Couri Brothers Supermarket,” a business which their father began in 1928. The brothers agreed that they would have equal control of the partnership, share equally in profits and losses and have equal rights in the partnership property. The agreement was of indefinite duration.',\n",

Defendant began working in the store in the early 30’s and in 1941, following his father’s death, assumed responsibility for the books and records of the newly formed partnership. Defendant continued to work full time at the store until 1946, when plaintiff returned from the Army and resumed his full-time position. Thereafter defendant apparently worked part time for several years until he formed another unrelated partnership, a tavern called the “Western Tap.” From approximately 1949 until 1956, defendant devoted most of his time to that business while plaintiff continued to work full time in the supermarket. It was apparently during that time that Peter Couri entered medical school, and in 1954 plaintiff and defendant purchased his interest in the partnership. Their oral agreement was of indefinite duration, and provided that they would, in all respects, be equal partners.\\nDefendant sold the Western Tap in 1956, and for the next 10 years devoted a good deal of his time to real estate ventures on behalf of the supermarket partnership.

The circumstances under which the disagreement and dissolution of the partnership occurred were sharply disputed: Plaintiff claimed that he was precluded by defendant from full participation in the management and operation of the partnership, while defendant claimed that plaintiff abandoned the business and thereafter refused to participate. Although neither party acquiesced in the other’s characterization of the circumstances surrounding plaintiff’s departure, the trial court determined that the partnership was rightfully dissolved, a finding which has not been challenged on appeal.\\nIn November 1973, plaintiff visited defendant at his home and requested and received some of the partnership records for the prior two years. The parties, however, were unable to resolve their differences, and plaintiff consequently demanded that defendant wind up the partnership affairs. Instead, in July 1974, defendant changed the locks on the store, closed out the partnership checking account, opened a new account which was in his exclusive control, changed the name of the grocery store from “Couri Brothers Supermarket” to “Couri’s Supermarket,” and continued to operate the store until the court-appointed receiver wound up the partnership affairs and disposed of its assets.',\n",

There were daily reports, and monthly and yearly summaries. The tax returns were prepared from the latter two. The daily reports were theoretically restated in the monthly and yearly summaries; however, at least for the years 1971 through 1974, income was admittedly substantially understated so that the summaries and tax returns for those periods did not accurately reflect actual income. The parties agreed at trial and in the appellate court that income could be reliably verified from the daily reports, a concession which the appellate court found difficult to accept because of its belief that those records could not have accurately reflected the partnership’s net profit. It seems clear, however, that those records, if adequately explained, represented the most accurate description of the financial operation of the partnership. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the daily reports, which were in defendant’s possession and under his control, were destroyed approximately two years after this litigation began. Despite a court order prohibiting defendant from destroying, altering or otherwise modifying any of the partnership’s books and records, defendant’s son cleaned his parents’ attic, while the latter two were vacationing, resulting in the disposal of several boxes containing daily reports. According to the boy’s testimony, he was instructed to clean the garagg and attic by his mother, who testified she acted without consulting defendant.',\n",

In response to the court’s order requiring defendant to account for this period, defendant produced books, records, bank statements, and tax returns which may, at best, be described as contradictory and incomplete. Such daily reports as were available were mainly copies which plaintiff had fortuitously made of reports which he had received prior to trial but which were returned by him and were among those destroyed.

Defendant’s total figures varied from approximately $433,600 to $487,000, whereas plaintiff asserted that defendant’s figures should be increased by approximately $527,000, resulting in a total in excess of $1 million. The estimated reported income (tax returns for four or five years were not produced and were no longer, available from the Internal Revenue Service) was approximately $424,000. The trial judge, who succeeded the originally assigned judge and whom the parties stipulated should decide the case on the basis of the transcripts and any additional hearings, determined that the accounting filed by defendant for the years 1957 through June 30, 1980, did not accurately reflect the net income of the partnership. Rather, the court found that the actual net income was $750,000. Further, .Jpased upon admissions in the record, the court found that defendant had drawn $88,000 from partnership funds in excess of that drawn by plaintiff. The court held, however, that defendant was entitled to compensation in the amount of $65,000 for the period from 1974 to June 30, 1980.

Plaintiff cross-appealed, arguing that the award should have been based upon an actual income in excess of $1 million. In addition, plaintiff argued that defendant was not entitled to the $65,000 compensation award. The appellate court, accepting one of defendant’s arguments, reversed and dismissed plaintiff’s petition for an accounting. It held that, notwithstanding defendant’s duty to account, based upon the available incomplete evidence as well as the unreliability of the tax returns, plaintiff had failed to demonstrate an amount to which he was entitled. Although doubting the reliability of the daily reports, the court stated that once those documents were “innocuously swept away,” an accounting became not only impractical but unattainable, and it was thus impossible to compute how much was due either party.\\nIn our judgment the basic flaw in the appellate court’s reasoning is its mischaracterization of the consequences of the breaches of defendant’s fiduciary duties and the destruction of the daily records which the court had ordered him to preserve. Those records were in defendant’s sole possession and control, and while the defendant’s proof indicates he did not know they were being destroyed, it is clear that he had not informed his family of their importance and the necessity^ of their preservation. Plaintiff’s inability to be more specific in his proof is the direct result of the breach of defendant’s obligations under the court order as well as his failure to adequately discharge his fiduciary duties.',\n",

The decision date is (1983-01-24)\\n\\nThe basic partnership principles involved here are well settled. A fiduciary relationship existed between the partners and embraced all matters relating to the partnership business; each was bound to exercise the utmost good faith and honesty in all dealings and transactions relating to the partnership. (Rizzo v. Rizzo (1954), 3 Ill. 2d 291, 302; Bakalis v. Bressler (1953), 1 Ill. 2d 72, 78-79; Einsweiler v. Einsweiler (1945), 390 Ill. 286, 293; see also Burtell v. First Charter Service Corp. (1979), 76 Ill. 2d 427, 437-38.) As the managing partner who was admittedly responsible for virtually all of the financial aspects of the partnership, defendant had a duty, as trustee, to maintain regular and accurate records and to account for partnership transactions. (Altschuler v. Altschuler (1951), 410 Ill. 169, 177-78, 196-97; see also Bakalis v. Bressler (1953), 1 Ill. 2d 72, 78-79; Einsweiler v. Einsweiler (1945), 390 Ill. 286, 293; Wylie v. Bushnell (1917), 277 Ill. 484, 491; Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 106½, pars. 20, 21(1), 22.) All doubts and obscurities created by his own negligent failure to keep adequate records were properly resolved against him by the trial court. Altschuler v. Altschuler (1951), 410 Ill. 169, 196-97; Crimp v. First Union Trust & Savings Bank (1933), 352 Ill. 93, 102; Crane & Bromberg, Partnership sec. 66, at 384 (1968).',\n",

Thus, unlike the case relied upon by the appellate court (Fineman v. Goldberg (1928), 329 Ill. 507), the evidence here, although voluminous, is not in such a state of uncertainty that it is impossible to determine whether any amount is due. We note, too, that in Fineman, although the defendant did obstruct the effort to state an account, plaintiff’s failure to keep records during his tenure as managing partner also contributed to the problem.

Based upon the available books and records, the testimony and reports of two accountants, the testimony of the parties, and the reasonable inferences from the evidence, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that income was substantially greater than defendant contended. Indeed it was evident that the tax returns were not accurate, as the appellate court (whose statement of facts has been adopted by defendant in this court) conceded. The trial court had evidence from which it could determine the approximate amount of the understatement for the years 1971-74. Further, the court could well have rejected much of defendant’s evidence and testimony concerning the period from 1974-80, given the absence of any daily reports (which he no longer prepared) or other supporting documents to verify actual income, and the obvious disparity between the profits defendant claimed and the known profits for the period in which he admitted the understatements. Too, the probative value of defendant’s explanation concerning his change of accounting methods and his testimony concerning the accrual method upon which he had previously operated was not great. Even assuming that he had attempted to follow that method in previous years — which an accountant commissioned by the court was unable to verify from records which seemed to indicate the contrary — his methods were inconsistent with accepted accounting principles. Thus, had the court, based upon this evidence, determined that defendant continued to understate income during the years 1974-80, albeit in a somewhat lesser amount, it could have reasonably concluded that the net income of the partnership over the period in question was $750,000.

The decision date is (1983-01-24)\\n\\nDefendant’s alternative position that plaintiff was guilty of laches is unpersuasive. He argues that he should not have been required to account for net profits for any period prior to 1966. In rejecting a similar claim in Einsweiler v. Einsweiler (1945), 390 Ill. 286, 292, this court stated that “[t]he general rule, subject to few exceptions, is that an action for a partnership accounting cannot be brought until the partnership has been dissolved. [Citations.] So long as a partnership continues, failure to demand a partnership accounting does not amount to laches. [Citations.]” (Accord, Korziuk v. Korziuk (1958), 13 Ill. 2d 238, 242; see also Rizzo v. Rizzo (1954), 3 Ill. 2d 291, 303-04.) Since plaintiff instituted his action for an accounting within a few months following the dissolution and the partners’ unsuccessful attempt to resolve their differences, he is obviously not guilty of laches, and the trial court properly ordered defendant to render the accounting.\\nAs we have indicated, the trial court had sufficient evidence from which it could determine the approximate net income of the partnership, and its finding in the amount of $750,000 is not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Given the difficulties of proof, which were largely of defendant’s making, the court’s finding is not an unreasonable resolution of the parties’ conflicting claims. While the trial court undoubtedly relied, to some extent, on plaintiff’s evidence concerning the proper method by which to increase the income beyond that actually reported, the court was not required to accept plaintiff’s suggestion that defendant understated income over the entire period from 1957 to June 1980 in a consistent manner. Indeed, the court might well have concluded that the income could not have been substantially understated for most of the 1960’s if it accepted the evidence which indicated that profits would have been insignificant during this period.',\n",

The decision date is (1983-01-24)\\n\\nPlaintiff’s final argument is that defendant was not entitled to compensation for operating the grocery store from 1974 to June 30, 1980. His point is well taken. In the absence of an agreement, “[n]o partner is entitled to remuneration for acting in the partnership business, except that a surviving partner is entitled to reasonable compensation for his services in winding up the partnership affairs.” (Ill. Rev. Stat. (1981), ch. 106½, par. 18(f); see In re Estate of Barbera (1973), 55 Ill. 2d 235; Bach v. Bach (1940), 373 Ill. 442, 445; 1 S. Rowley, Partnership 484-98 (2d ed. I960).) In this case, there was no agreement, defendant was not a “surviving” partner, and he did not “wind up” the partnership’s affairs following the rightful dissolution, as it was his duty to do. No compensation is allowed if a partner improperly continues the business instead of winding it up. (Crane & Bromberg, Partnership sec. 83, at 474 (1968); Wickstrom v. Davis (1957), 211 Or. 254, 315 P.2d 597.) In those instances where compensation has been allowed, it was clear that the business was continued by consent or there were other considerations making such an equitable allowance just. (E.g., Timmermann v. Timmermann (1975), 272 Or. 613, 538 P.2d 1254; Vangel v. Vangel (1955), 45 Cal. 2d 804, 809, 291 P.2d 25, 28.) In addition to the reasons already stated, we believe that such an allowance would be inappropriate here since the evidence established that there were several years in which plaintiff also devoted his full-time services to the partnership for which he was not compensated. Absent an agreement, courts will not attempt to equalize compensation commensurate with services (Bach v. Bach (1940), 373 Ill. 442, 445; Brownell v. Steere (1889), 128 Ill. 209, 212; Burgess v. Badger (1888), 124 Ill. 288, 301-02); accordingly we will not do so here.',\n",

The greater portion of the district lies within the city limits of the city of Belleville, in said St Clair county. A natural channel, known as Richland creek, now flows lengthwise through the proposed district and drains it. The plan of the proposed district, according to the petition, is to “deepen, widen and straighten said cr.eek and to re-locate the channel thereof wherever within said proposed district the same may be deemed necessary, and in furtherance of this purpose to construct a ditch, with levees when necessary, following the general course of said creek, or a lower level, with sufficient width and fall to drain properly the territory described herein for sanitary purposes, to keep the channel of said ditch free and clear from driftwood and obstructions, and otherwise to provide, maintain and keep in repair a complete and general system of drainage for sanitary purposes for the lands lying within the boundaries of said proposed district.”' The hearing on the original petition was set for January 19, 1916, no objections being filed at said hearing by any of the plaintiffs in error.

The trial court fixed the hearing on said report for April 26, 1916. No objections were filed to the said report, and on that date default was entered as to all parties, and an order was entered approving the report of said commissioners and for the organization of said district.

Reference to existing monuments is a usual and approved method for describing real estate. (People v. Willison, 237 Ill. 584; City of Lincoln v.

(People v. Willison, supra; People v. Brown, 261 Ill. 73.) A description of real estate which refers to objects as fixed and existing will be presumed to be correct, and it will be presumed that the things referred to as monuments can be found.

The decision date is (1917-10-23)\\n\\nWe do not think the petition was defective in not giving the total acreage of the district or the number of acres owned by the respective signers. The statute does not so require. It only requires that the petition shall be so drawn that in itself it will afford information from which the acreage of the district and the signers of the petition can be ascertained by investigation. The petition in this case, we think, contains such information. Furthermore, we do not think, on the reasoning of this -court in Donner v. Highway Comrs. 278 Ill. 189, where the facts were somewhat similar, that the plaintiffs in error could raise in the lower court, at the time they made the motion, the question of the legal organization of the district. On the hearing of the petition, as well as on the hearing of the commissioners’ report, it became the duty of the trial court, under sections 5 and 17 of the Levee act, to inquire into and hear evidence on the sufficiency of the petition and the commissioners’ report and to enter judgment, according to its findings. As no bill of exceptions containing the evidence on which the court below acted is in the record, it must be presumed that sufficient evidence was heard to sustain the findings of the trial court. The presumption of the correctness and regularity of judicial proceedings will obtain until error therein is shown by the record. (Gross v. Village of Grossdale, 176 Ill. 572; Modern Woodmen v. Davis, 184 id. 236; Kelly v. City of Chicago, 148 id. 90.) It must be held that this is a collateral attack under the reasoning of this court in Dormer v. Highway Comrs. supra, and even on direct attack, there being no bill of exceptions taken at the term at which the hearing on the legal objections was had, the legality of the organization of the district could not be questioned.

We do not think the jurisdictional features of the original petition can be questioned on this hearing. Neither do we think the amendments were of a material- character. On any of the points raised as to the sufficiency of the petition the amendments might properly be expunged of record as surplusage, and hence the questions raised with reference to these amendments need not be considered.

These contracts were attached to the assessment roll. Section 17 of the Levee act authorizes the commissioners to acquire the right of way and give releases of damages for the construction of the proposed work by agreement, and section 55 of the act contemplates that when the commissioners and the railroad companies agree as to the amount they shall contribute, the amount so agreed upon shall be reported to the jury when it meets to correct the assessment roll, and the amount so agreed upon shall be incorporated in the assessment roll by the jury or the commissioners. These contracts are quite similar to those passed on by this court in Vandalia Drainage District v. Vandalia Railroad Co. 247 Ill. 114, and what was said in that case concerning any mistakes made in making the contracts, as to future assessments, will apply here with equal force. The court there said (p. 123) : “The commissioners have no more power, to relieve railroad companies and towns from future assessments than they have to relieve other land owners from such assessments. The contracts under consideration can therefore be given no other effect than to fix the amount of the first assessment against the plaintiff in error railroad companies, * * * and are no bar to an additional assessment or to an annual assessment for repairs against them.” It is further argued by plaintiffs in error that the $58,-090 assessed against the city of Belleville is unreasonable and unjust, and therefore excessive and void.

The decision date is (1917-10-23)\\n\\nIn this connection it may be noted that counsel, on the trial before the jury on the question of benefits, attempted to show that certain property was assessed out of proportion to other property in the assessment roll. The jury have nothing to do with that question. If any such question was to be raised it should have been raised and the point preserved on the hearing of the legal objections. City of East St. Louis v. Illinois Central Railroad Co. 238 Ill. 296, and cases cited.\\nCounsel for plaintiffs in error argue earnestly and at some length that the property they represent is assessed more than it will be benefited, and that the compensation for the property taken is not as much as it should have been. They state, however, that the evidence on these questions was very conflicting and that “the estimates of the witnesses for objectors and for petitioner vary widely.\" When the evidence is conflicting on questions of this nature, and particularly on issues to be determined wholly by the opinions of witnesses, this court will not interfere with the judgment of the lower court and the verdict of the jury unless the finding of the lower court is clearly and palpably against the weight of the evidence. (City of Chicago v. Weber, 260 Ill. 105; City of Chicago v. McKinlock, 256 id. 38; Topliff v. City of Chicago, 196 id. 215.) The finding of the jury on these questions was clearly within the range of the testimony of the various witnesses, and even though we might be inclined to differ from the finding if we were hearing this matter as an original proceeding, \"still we cannot say that the finding on these questions is clearly against the weight of the evidence, and therefore are not warranted in setting aside the judgment on those questions.',\n",

It is clear from the finding of the jury that they did not consider themselves mandatorially directed to return a certain verdict, for in fixing the compensation and benefits they did not follow the assessment roll or the evidence of any given witness but changed the amounts as to séveral of the objectors- as fixed by the assessment roll.

The decision date is (1972-11-30)\\n\\nProsecution witness Willard Ingersoll testified that on November 7, 1965, he was employed as an attendant at Trucker’s Paradise, a gas station, located at 1234 West Cermak Road, Chicago. At approximately 6:00 P.M. Ingersoll weighed a truck on the station’s truck scale which is located directly in front of the station office. Truck driver Harry Ganzen, after driving his truck off the scale, went into the station house washroom. At this time the assailant, having driven his automobile, identified as a maroon 1963 Oldsmobile “98” sedan, up to the pump area some 100 feet from the station house, walked up to Ingersoll, who was inside the station, and requested that his gas tank be filled, the oil checked and the windows wiped. As Ingersoll was servicing the car, Hugo Rodriguez, a fellow employee, drove up, walked over to Ingersoll and accompanied him back to the station house to show the location of the switch for the outdoor vapor lights. As they entered they saw the assailant sitting in a phone booth located inside and in the rear area of the station house. At this time the interior station lights and the pump lights were already on. Rodriguez then left the station and Ingersoll returned to servicing the assailant’s auto, at which time he saw the assailant walking around the truck-parking area of the gas-station lot. Ingersoll was unable to locate the oil dipstick and walked up to the assailant, who was then standing in the station doorway drinking a soda, and asked for assistance. The assailant returned to the car with Ingersoll, pointed to the oil dipstick and then went back into the station house. Ingersoll finished servicing the auto, went into the station house and advised the assailant of the amount of the bill. The assailant, standing directly across the office counter from Ingersoll, stated it would be a charge, but when he gave the name, Ingersoll informed him that that party did not have a charge account.

Ingersoll waited one to two minutes, heard the assailant return to the washroom, heard a gunshot and had turned his head to the left when another shot was fired striking him between the eyes and exiting through his right temple causing blindness in the right eye. Ingersoll stated that $190 was taken from the station, including $40 of his personal funds.\\nShortly after Ingersoll’s release from the hospital he and Rodriguez jointly described the assailant to the police as being a Negro, 6 feet in height, weighing 160 pounds, with black hair, brown eyes, light brown complexion, sunken cheeks with pock marks, one day’s growth of beard, Caucasian features, i.e., “his ears, they weren’t flatly pressed down and he didn’t have such a large nose and his lips, they weren’t that thick”, approximately 45 to 50 years of age, rather well dressed and wearing a hat. A composite sketch was later drawn.\\nIngersoll further testified that during the following months he viewed approximately 2,000 police photographs, though never identifying any of them except to note that several exhibited facial characteristics similar to those of the assailant; that on December 28, 1967, he was shown a photograph of the defendant upon which a police artist had drawn a hat, and immediately identified the defendant as being the assailant. Ingersoll had not previously been shown a photograph of defendant. He also picked defendant in a five-man lineup held later that day and recognized defendant’s voice, it being somewhat unusually high pitched.

In November, 1965, however, two past-due installments were paid by the defendant but no payment was made in December of 1965.

That basis for objection has been eliminated, of course, by Kirby v. Illinois (1972), 406 U.S. 682, 32 L. Ed. 2d 411, 92 S. Ct. 1877, and People v.

We conclude, therefore, that defendant’s failure to object in the trial court to the “suggestiveness” of this procedure would, of itself, preclude consideration of the issue now raised. People v.

Although the photographic identification procedure now complained of is not to be commended, the factual circumstances disclosed by the record indicate, in our opinion that the witness’s identification of defendant had an origin independent of the photographic identification proceedings and was uninfluenced thereby (People v. Martin (1970) 47 Ill.2d 331, 337-338; People v. McMath (1970), 45 Ill.2d 33, 37), for Ingersoll had an excellent opportunity to observe the defendant at the time of the crime. (People v. Speck (1968), 41 Ill.2d 177.) During the approximately 20 minutes that elapsed between the defendant’s first entry into the station and the shooting of Ingersoll, the latter conversed with defendant face to face in good lighting on three separate occasions. Defendant also accompanied Ingersoll to the car to help locate the oil dipstick, and Ingersoll, of course, observed at close range as the defendant struggled with the truck driver. We note, too, that Ingersoll immediately identified defendant at the police lineup, and also recognized his voice, and was positive of his identification during cross-examination. People v. Blumenshine (1969), 42 Ill.2d 508 514.\\nDefendant points to a more than two-year lapse of time before he was identified, the discrepancy between defendant’s age (approximately 32 years of age at the time of the crime) and the witnesses’ estimate thereof, Rodriguez’s testimony that he had thought the assailant was a little taller and older than defendant and his failure to positively identify defendant in court, and the difference between certain of the defendant’s features, namely nose and lips, and the composite police sketch as combining to raise a reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt.

The decision date is (1972-11-30)\\n\\n“We have often stated that positive identification by a single witness who has ample opportunity for observation is sufficient to support a conviction.” (People v. Clarke (1971), 50 Ill.2d 104, 110.) The lapse of time goes only to the weight of the testimony, a question for the jury, and does not destroy the witness’s credibility. Furthermore, the identification testimony was in part corroborated by the matching description of defendant’s car with the car of the assailant.\\nDefendant next argues that the evidence of Ingersoll’s injury was irrelevant and inflammatory. After explaining the location of the bullet wound, Ingersoll was asked if he had suffered any resulting impairment of his right eye. Over defendant’s objection, he answered that he had no sight in the right eye. Without deciding the relevancy of that statement (People v. Nickolopoulus (1962), 25 Ill.2d 451), it is our opinion that it was not so highly inflammatory as to deny defendant a fair trial.\\nDefendant also contends that the admission of evidence of his personal finances was prejudicial error for it was allegedly irrelevant as to motive and inadmissible for any other purpose. We cannot agree. The pattern of late payments followed by payments in an amount almost equal to that taken in the robbery, which were made contemporaneously with the crime, is corroborating circumstantial evidence of defendant’s guilt. “The test of admissibility of evidence is whether it fairly tends to prove the particular offense charged and any circumstance may be put in evidence which tends to make the proposition at issue either more or less probable.” (People v. Nemke (1970), 46 Ill.2d 49, 58.) We think this evidence meets that test.',\n",

The decision date is (1972-11-30)\\n\\nFinally defendant argues that the trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant to elicit from a police officer called by the defense an alleged prior inconsistent description of the assailant given by the identifying witness and allegedly contained in the police report. In our opinion such testimony was properly excluded, inasmuch as it was an improper attempt to impeach the identifying witness by introducing a prior inconsistent statement without first laying the proper foundation. “[B] efore a witness maybe impeached by his prior inconsistent statement he must be alerted concerning it in order to avoid unfair surprise and to give him an opportunity to explain.” (People v. Moses (1957), 11 Ill.2d 84, 87.) Defense counsel had possession of the police report during his cross-examination of both Ingersoll and Rodriguez, and, despite full opportunity to do so, did not lay a foundation for possible impeachment. No questions were asked relating to prior inconsistent statements, no offers to prove such statements were made, nor is there in this record any indication that the police reports did, in fact, contain impeaching material in addition to that previously indicated herein.\\nAccordingly, the judgment of the appellate court is affirmed.\\nJudgment affirmed.\\nMR. JUSTICE WARD took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.',\n",

The decision date is (1989-04-20)\\n\\nJUSTICE STOUDER,\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nScott Theede appeals from the judgment of the circuit court of Tazewell County, denying his motion to open a judgment by confession. Theede’s affidavit and supplemental affidavit in support of his motion indicate that Theede held a business account with Herget National Bank and was given a $30,000 line of credit. In September of 1986, the bank dishonored a $15,000 check drawn on Theede’s business account. When Theede contacted Jerry Towle, a commercial loan officer for the bank, to determine the bank’s reason for dishonoring the check, Towle informed Theede that his line of credit was depleted. Thinking that the bank had made a clerical error since he had not used his line of credit, Theede, along with his wife, Barbara, and a friend, Harold O’Hara, met with Towle on September 19,1986, to discuss the problem.\\nAt the meeting, Theede was shown a computer printout of multiple loans made to his wife secured by promissory notes which bore the signatures of both Theede and his wife. Theede explained that his signatures were not authorized, and he could not get an explanation for the situation from his wife, who “could only cry.” Though his friend, O’Hara, was an attorney, he gave Theede no legal advice at the time. -\\nThereafter, Theede arranged to meet with Towle on September 23, 1986. Theede was concerned about his financial reputation and wanted to convince the bank to honor his check. Towle told Theede that the bank would honor his check if he would sign a promissory note for $60,800, which would consolidate all of the loans made to his wife. Because Theede thought and was led to believe by the bank that he was liable for his wife’s debts, and because he was desperate to stay in the livestock business, he signed the $60,800 consolidation note.',\n",

The decision date is (1989-04-20)\\n\\nWhen the note became due on March 23, 1987, Theede met with Towle and paid $800 on the principal plus $3,367.32 in interest. Thereafter, Theede sought legal advice and learned that he was not responsible for the debts of his wife. Accordingly, he ceased payment on the note.\\nIn response, the bank, pursuant to a clause in the note, obtained a judgment by confession against Theede on August 4, 1987. Theede first learned of the judgment when he was served by a citation to discover his assets on November 25, 1987. He then filed his motion to open the judgment by confession. When the court denied his motion, he brought this appeal.\\nThe first issue presented by this case is whether the circuit court erred in concluding that the cognovit note was not used in a consumer transaction. Section 2 — 1301(c) of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 110, par. 1 — 101 et seq.) provides that any power to confess judgment in an instrument used in a consumer transaction “is null and void and any judgment entered by a court based on such power shall be unenforceable.” (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 110, par. 2 — 1301(c).) The Code further provides that a loan is a “consumer transaction” if it was made “to an individual for purposes that are primarily personal, family, or household.” Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 110, par. 2 — 1301(c).',\n",

The decision date is (1989-04-20)\\n\\nThe pleadings and affidavits filed by both parties indicate that the purpose of the loan at issue was to consolidate prior loans made to Barbara Theede, who allegedly forged her husband’s name as comaker on notes evidencing the prior loans. The prior loans are all either renewal notes or consolidation notes or both. While Theede asserts that the purpose of his .signing for the loan at issue was personal in nature, he does not deny that most of the proceeds from such prior loans are traceable to deposits made to his business account at the bank. Moreover, Theede admits that one reason for his signing the note was to assure that the bank would honor a check which was drawn on his business account.\\nWhile he also asserts that he signed because of his concern for his personal financial reputation, he does not deny that his personal financial reputation is indistinct from his financial reputation as a sole proprietor of Theede Livestock. Thus, other than Theede’s bald assertion that the purpose for his signing the note was personal, there is nothing to indicate that the loan was made for any reason other than to maintain his business. Therefore, we agree with the circuit court and conclude that as a matter of law the confession of judgment clause in this promissory note was not used in a consumer transaction such as to render the clause void or the judgment entered thereon unenforceable.',\n",

The decision date is (1989-04-20)\\n\\nThe next issue is whether the circuit court erred in concluding that Theede failed to allege sufficient facts to support his asserted defenses. A trial court’s review of a motion to open a judgment by confession examines the legal sufficiency of the well-pleaded allegations of the motion as filed with its accompanying affidavits. (Gleneke v. Lesny (1970), 130 Ill. App. 2d 116, 119, 264 N.E.2d 803, 804-05.) If such allegations disclose a cognizable defense to a judgment by confession, the defendant’s motion will be granted and the cause will proceed to a hearing on the defense. (87 Ill. 2d R. 276; Harris Bank Argo v. Midpack Corp. (1986), 151 Ill. App. 3d 293, 294, 502 N.E.2d 1127, 1128.) The plaintiff may file counteraffidavits; however, its allegations are considered only to the extent that they are consistent with the allegations of the defendant. 87 Ill. 2d R. 276; First National Bank v. Achilli (1973), 14 Ill. App. 3d 1, 4, 301 N.E.2d 739, 741.',\n",

The decision date is (1989-04-20)\\n\\nIn this case Theede first asserts that he alleged sufficient facts to support his defense of economic or moral duress. The defense of economic duress is also known as “business compulsion” (Kewanee Production Credit Association v. G. Larson & Sons Farms, Inc. (1986), 146 Ill. App. 3d 301, 305, 496 N.E.2d 531, 534) and is similar to “moral duress.” (See People ex rel. Buell v. Bell (1959), 20 Ill. App. 2d 82, 95, 155 N.E.2d 104, 111.) The defense of economic duress differs from moral duress primarily in the theoretical basis for recovery, which in both cases is release from obligation under the contract. Economic duress permits release on the theory that the party is deemed to have lacked the mental capacity requisite to the making of a contract. (See Kaplan v. Kaplan (1962), 25 Ill. 2d 181, 186-87, 182 N.E.2d 706, 709.) Moral duress permits release on the theory that “the party benefiting thereby has received money, property, or other advantage which in equity and good conscience he should not be permitted to retain.” (Bell, 20 Ill. App. 2d at 95, 155 N.E.2d at 111.) To sustain a claim under either theory sufficient to render a contract unenforceable, the party must show that he was induced to enter into a contract by some wrongful act of the other contracting parly. (J.D. Alexander v. Standard Oil Co. (1981), 97 Ill. App. 3d 809, 815, 423 N.E.2d 578, 582.) Duress is not shown by the fact that one was subjected to mere annoyance, vexation, personal embarrassment (Kaplan, 25 Ill. 2d at 186, 182 N.E.2d at 710), a difficult bargaining position or the pressure of financial circumstances (Kewanee, 146 Ill. App. 3d at 305, 496 N.E.2d at 534). There must have been some “imposition, oppression, undue influence, or the taking of undue advantage of the business or financial stress or extreme necessities or weaknesses] of another.” Bell, 20 Ill. App. 2d at 95, 155 N.E.2d at 111.',\n",

Theede states that he was desperate to save his financial reputation because of the dishonored check. He told Towle that he was willing to do anything to have the check honored by the bank, which would save his reputation. He also asserts that Towle led him to believe that he was responsible for the loans executed by his wife. Further, Towle told him that if he would sign a note for the $60,800, consolidating all of the loans made to his wife, the bank would honor his check and they would later discuss the issues relating to his wife’s forging his signature on the other notes.

The decision date is (1989-04-20)\\n\\nTheede also asserts the defense of unilateral mistake of law. To be entitled to equitable relief for one’s unilateral mistake of law, the mistaken party must show, in addition to his mistake as to his legal rights or responsibilities prior to entering the transaction, some wrongful conduct by the nonmistaken parly that induced the mistaken party to act in favor of the nonmistaken party. (Bayne v. Cinak (1925), 320 Ill. 23, 28, 150 N.E. 344, 346.) In this case Theede asserts that he was mistaken as to his legal rights regarding the note. The bank does not deny Theede’s assertion, but it argues that Theede failed to allege any wrongful conduct on its part that induced Theede to sign the note. However, in his affidavits, Theede alleges that he signed the note because Towle led him to believe that he was liable for the loans executed by his wife. He further asserts that Towle knew that Theede was not liable for those loans. We conclude that these allegations are sufficient to establish wrongful conduct on the part of the bank and are, therefore, sufficient to sustain a claim for unilateral mistake of law. Thus, the circuit court erred in denying Theede’s motion to open the judgment by confession on this basis as well.\\nTheede argues, finally, that he alleged sufficient facts to support his defense of lack of consideration. While he asserts that no consideration was given for his signing the promissory note, Theede admits that he signed partly because he wanted the bank to honor his dishonored cheek. Theede does not deny that the formerly dishonored check was honored by the bank after he signed the promissory note. Thus, it appears that Theede received some benefit, which is sufficient consideration for his signing the note. Theede’s asserted defense of lack of consideration is, therefore, without factual support, and the circuit court was correct in denying his motion as to that defense.',\n",

Complainant suggested that a division of the merchandise be made, but defendant would not agree to this. Complainant then suggested that the goods be sold on as short terms as possible, which was agreed to by defendant. Complainant repeatedly asked defendant for an accounting after this date. Defendant said he would wait until all goods were sold and they would then make a division of the profits. On one occasion defendant ordered complainant out of his office. On July 26, 1919, according to the defendant’s testimony, he drove complainant away from the store, and on another occasion defendant had a policeman remove him from the premises. After July 26, 1919, complainant had nothing to do with the business. Defendant had full charge, including the keeping of the books, to which complainant',\n",

The decision date is (1928-02-24)\\n\\nThe rule is well settled that where evidence or exhibits are omitted from the record a court of review will presume that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the decree. (Kennard v. Curran, 239 Ill. 122; McKennan v. Mickelberry, 242 id. 117; People v. Niehoff, 266 id. 103.) That rule, however, is not applicable to the facts now before us. The books, reports and other documents were not admitted in evidence. Some of them were offered but were not admitted. No error was assigned on any of these rulings either in the trial court or in the Appellate Court. No objection was made to the certificate of evidence as signed by the chancellor and no suggestion was made in the Appellate Court of a diminution of the record. The first time a. complaint was made in this regard was after the Appellate Court had reversed the decree with directions. As a matter of fact, it is admitted that the books from September 30 to March 11 were of no value in stating the account. The books from July 26 to November 30 were made under the direction of the defendant, with no opportunity to complainant to see or examine them, and for this reason they were not admissible as a record against complainant. The books from March 11, 1919, to July 26, 1919, contained very little controverted matter except as to sums paid out for expenses, and during a part of this period complainant was prevented from seeing them. If defendant wanted these various items of evidence in the record he should have made the offers and assigned error upon the rulings, which he did not do. For that reason he is in no position to take advantage of the situation for the first time in this court. The parties had the right to try their case as they saw fit, according to the rules of law. Almost 900 pages of evidence was taken, consisting of the testimony of the parties, of the accountants and of other witnesses.

The decision date is (1928-02-24)\\n\\nIn stating the account the first- question is to determine the profits from September 30, 1918, to March 11, 1919. It is conceded that this cannot be determined from the books kept during this period. The double-entry set of books opened on March 11, 1919, was installed by John M. Delson, an accountant who was a distant relative of defendant’s wife. In the first pages of these books he made memoranda in which he places the expenses at $931, the purchases at $9914.64, the sales at $11,471.19, the goods on hand March 11, 1919, at $12,479.58, and the profits at $573.60. None of these items are sustained by the preponderance of the evidence except as to the goods on hand. Complainant testified that the expenses from September 30, 1918, to January 11, 1919, did not exceed $50, and from January 11, 1919, to March 11, 1919, they were $300. There is no evidence of any other items of expense. There was no expense for rent or light, no book-keeper was employed until March 1, and complainant did most of the work. Evidence was offered by defendant that on March 11, 1919, complainant agreed that the profits up to that date were only $573.60. This contention is not sustained by the evidence. The preponderance of the evidence shows that complainant was in New York on March 11, 1919, when the new books were opened and when the alleged agreement was made, and that he was not present at the time Delson testified he agreed to $573.60 as profits. The preponderance of the evidence not only shows that such an agreement was not made, but the undisputed facts in evidence are contrary to such a conclusion. On March 11 the business had been in operation almost six months. If the profits during this period had only been $573.60, such profits would not have justified the new financial obligations which were incurred during that time. The undisputed evidence is that during that period the business was enlarged, it was moved into larger and more commodious quarters, more rent was to be paid, a',\n",

The undisputed evidence is that during that period the business was enlarged, it was moved into larger and more commodious quarters, more rent was to be paid, a double-entry set of books was opened, a book-keeper was employed at $18 per week, $35,000 was borrowed to carry on the business, complainant moved his own stock of goods into the new quarters, devoted his entire time to the new business and was allowed to draw $50 per week against his share of the profits. In the face of all these undisputed facts defendant contends that complainant agreed that the profits for this period were only $573.60, and Delsón so entered that agreement on the books. Complainant testified, without contradiction, that from September 30, 1918, to January 11, 1919, about $10,000 worth of goods were purchased; that about 95 per cent of these goods were sold at 20 per cent profit, with a total expense of not to exceed $50; that from January 11, 1919, to March 11, 1919, $45,000 worth of goods were bought and the expenses were not to exceed $300. We think complainant is sustained in these figures by other facts in evidence. For example, defendant testified that complainant in January, 1919, went to New York and purchased $20,000 to $25,000 worth of goods, and that he and complainant went to New York in February, 1919, and bought $20,000, $25,000 or $30,000 worth of goods. If all these goods were purchased as testified by defendant and $35,000 was borrowed to carry on the business, it is apparent that the profits were more than $573.60 up to March ■ 11, 1919.',\n",

This finding is sustained by the preponderance of the evidence. From January 11, 1919, to March 11, 1919, the evidence shows $45,000 worth of goods were purchased, that $500 worth of goods were left on hand from the prior purchases, the expenses were $300, and the goods on hand on March 11, 1919, were worth $12,479.58. This leaves $33,020.42 as the value of the goods sold at 20 p°er cent, less $300 for expenses, or a net profit of $6304.08, of which 40 per cent, or $2521.63, was the share of complainant. This amount added to the $925 from September 30, 1918, to January 11, 1919, made a total profit of $3446.63 due complainant from September 30, 1918, to March 11, 1919, instead of $3502.68 as found by the Appellate Court. The master found the profits for this period to be 40 per cent of $573.60, or $229.40.\\nAs to the profits from March 11, 1919, to November 30, 1919, defendant filed with the master his account in which he admitted sales of $182,118.32, less the inventory of March 11, 1919, amounting to $12,479.58, and purchases of $139,232.88, leaving a balance of $30,405.86. To this he added $4091.19 as the inventory of goods which should have been on hand on November 30, 1919, as shown by the report of the auditors, together with $300 profit on a purchase contract, making $34,797.05 as the gross profits. From this he deducted $14,756.65 for expenses, leaving net profits of $20,040.40, complainant’s share being 40 per cent, or $8016.16. The master for the same period found that the gross profits were $30,705.86 and the expenses $8124.77, leaving a net profit of $22,581.09.

The decision date is (1928-02-24)\\n\\nIn estimating the profits from March 11, 1919, to November 30, 1919, the Appellate Court divided the time into two periods, the first one being from March 11, 1919, to July 26, 1919, the date defendant took exclusive possession of the goods; and the second one from July 26, 1919, to November 30, 1919. The Appellate Court found that from March 11, 1919, to July 26, 1919, the gross sales were $162,696.20 and the purchases $140,193, leaving $22,503.20 as the gross profits, from which $3559.29 was deducted for expenses, leaving $18,943.91 as the net profits, of which complainant was entitled to 40 per cent, or $7577.56. These figures were based upon the audit of Grawols. Complainant testified that on July 26, 1919, when he was excluded from the store, there were $35,000 worth of goods on hand. Defendant testified that on July 26, 1919, there were between $30,000 and $35,000 worth of goods on hand. By November 30, 1919, all of the goods were sold. Grawols testified that the average profits from March 11, 1919, to November 30, 1919, as determined by his auditor, were 21 y-2. per cent. The Appellate Court found that 21per cent of $35,000 (the value of the goods on hand) was $7525, the amount of the profits, and that complainant was entitled to 50 per cent of this, or $3762.50. We think the Appellate. Court was in error in dividing the profits equally, for the reason that under the contract of January 11, 1919, complainant was only entitled to 40 per cent of the profits, or $3010.',\n",

There is a difference of only $677.66 between the gross profits found by the master and the amount found by the Appellate Court. There is a difference of $4768.85 between the schedule of gross profits filed by the defendant with the master and the amount found by the Appellate Court. The defendant admitted $4768.85 more gross profits than the Appellate Court found were due.\\nAttached to the schedule filed by defendant with the master is a list of expenses charged, totaling $14,576.65. Included in this schedule is $1700 for services to Gurwit, a son-in-law of defendant. The evidence shows that Gurwit did not perform any services in the store under this contract and therefore was not entitled to any compensation, and both the master and the Appellate Court so found. Two thousand dollars was charged by defendant for his own services after July 26, 1919, and $1966.50 was charged for rent. Neither of these items, under the terms of the contract, was chargeable against complainant and both were properly rejected by the master and by the Appellate Court, making a total of $5666.50, which without question should be deducted from the $14,576.65 as claimed by defendant. Defendant in his schedule of expenses claimed $3478 for labor, but the master only allowed $812.70 of this amount.\",\n",

The decision date is (1928-02-24)\\n\\nThe book-keeper from March 11, 1919, to November 30, 1919, testified that she paid all bills by check and took receipts for all money paid out by her; that at the end of each month these receipts were placed in separate files and all of them were in the office when she quit work in March, 1920. On the trial defendant produced most of the checks used in paying these bills. He produced a few of the receipts and testified that he had no idea what became of the balance. Grawols testified that in his audit he found very few receipts. He did find some checks, but he did not consider that any item should be allowed as expenses unless there was a receipt and check for it. The account as filed by defendant not only contained $5666.50 for expenses for which he was not entitled to credit, but, in addition to this, one of the clerks employed in the clothing department of defendant’s store testified that defendant requested him to testify that the witness was not working in the clothing deparment of defendant’s store but was working for the Stein Textile Company so that the salary of the witness could be charged to the textile company, and it was so charged. The evidence also shows that in September, 1919, William Gold-rich purchased goods of the value of $1245.86 and Isadore Doctor made purchases of $1550.47, neither of which sales appeared upon the books. Grawols testified that he was unable to find sufficient sales to account for the purchases made, which left goods not accounted for. It is apparent from all of this evidence that the books did not state a true and correct account of all receipts and expenses. They could not be relied upon in stating the account, and for that reason the items of expense claimed by defendant and filed with the master should be scrutinized with care and ■only such items should be allowed as were clearly established by the evidence.',\n",

No claim in his favor will be established on mere probabilities, but every reasonable presumption will be made against him.” In 22 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 127, it was said: “If books are kept in such manner as to be unintelligible, or if they are destroyed or wrongfully withheld, and an accounting is directed by the court, every presumption will be made against those to whose negligence or misconduct the non-production of proper accounts is due.” In 20 R. C. L. (sec. 153, p. 934,) it is said: “Partnership books are admissible in evidence for the purpose of showing the state of the partnership affairs, éven when the entries are made by one partner alone, provided that the co-partners have access to the books and an opportunity to object to the entries in question.” Under these authorities the failure of defendant to produce the receipts raised the presumption that their production would be adverse to defendant.

The decision date is (1928-02-24)\\n\\nIn addition to the $3010 found due complainant as profits from July 26, 1919, to November 30, 1919, the Appellate Court found that complainant was entitled to $17,500, being one-half of the $35,000 worth of goods on hand on July 26, 1919, when defendant assumed exclusive charge of the business. In this finding we think the court was in error. The preponderance of the evidence shows that the value of the stock on July 26, 1919, was $35,000, $4554.56 in cash was in the bank and there were $38,000 of accounts on the books, practically all of which were subsequently collected by defendant. The evidence also shows that $36,000 was owing for money borrowed, which defendant paid after July 26. It is the contention of complainant that the accounts receivable and cash, amounting to $42,554.50, were more than enough to pay the $36,000 of money borrowed, and therefore he was entitled to one-half of the value of the goods on hand in addition to profits made on their sale. This contention is not correct. The account as stated covered all of the business transactions of every kind and character, including goods bought and goods sold, whether for cash or on account. The profits were determined by deducting from the total sales the cost of the goods and the expenses, and complainant was given credit for his share of the profits. All of these items were computed on a cash basis. The contract provided that upon the termination of the contract all stock on hand should be sold or divided, as the parties might agree, all outstanding accounts collected, all bills and liabilities paid, and the balance, if any, equally divided. This $36,000 of borrowed money did not represent an asset of the business but it was a liability. It had been borrowed and used for the purpose of increasing the working capital and for its use interest had been paid. The profits of complainant had been increased by its use. ■ Its use was taken into account in estimating the profits but it should not have been',\n",

The profits of complainant had been increased by its use. ■ Its use was taken into account in estimating the profits but it should not have been taken into consideration in determining the capital. The profits had not only been estimated on a cash basis but all of these profits in the estimate had been charged to defendant. He was therefore charged with the cash in the bank and the accounts receivable considered as cash. If he was charged with these amounts as cash and had to account to complainant for complainant’s share of them, it certainly cannot be said that they should be used in paying the $36,000 of borrowed money so as to divide the $35,000 worth of goods between the parties. On July 26, 1919, the parties had $35,000 worth of goods on hand, but they did not own $35,000 worth of goods on that date to be divided equally. They, in fact, owned no goods at that time for the reason that they owed $36,000 on those goods, or they owed it on their individual credit. Complainant was not entitled to one-half of the $35,000, and it should not have been included in the award.',\n",

The decision date is (1928-02-24)\\n\\nThe Appellate Court held that defendant was chargeable with interest from July 26, 1919, and' that he should pay all of the costs. Whether a partner is to be charged with interest depends upon the circumstances of each case. The fact that he has property of the partnership in his hands does not necessarily make him liable for interest where there has been no improper use of the partnership funds, no failure to account for the property or unreasonable delay in doing so. (Parish v. Bainum, 306 Ill. 618.) He is liable for interest if he has improperly used or neglected to account for the assets of the partnership before the bill for an accounting is filed. He is also liable for interest after the bill is filed if he throws obstacles in the way of the accounting and induces the court to withhold the hearing longer than it otherwise would have done. (Snell v. Taylor, 182 Ill. 473; Imperial Hotel Co. v. Claflin Co. 175 id. 119; Randolph v. Inman, 172 id. 575; Brownell v. Steere, 128 id. 209.) The payment of costs in chancery cases is largely within the discretion of the chancellor, but the discretion must be' exercised in accordance with the equities of the parties. (First Nat. Bank of Chrisman v. Watson, 277 Ill. 186.) In Keller v. Bading, 169 Ill. 152, it was said: “The claim asserted by appellants to this fund rendered the filing of this bill necessary on the part of appellees. Appellants did not disclaim but by their demurrer denied the right to relief. They were actively contesting the right of appellees to have a decree, and the costs were properly awarded against them.”\",\n",

How it should be sold or who should sell it was not specified. Defendant saw fit to take this burden upon himself. He sold it in about 100 days from the time he took exclusive possession. There is no evidence of unreasonable delay in making the sale. If he acted without delay in this respect he should not be charged with interest during that time. After the sale was completed he failed and refused to account, and he should be charged with interest from the date of that default, which was November 30, 1919. To the bill defendant filed an answer, in which he alleged that the contract was terminated on March 25, 1919, by mutual agreement, and that complainant was not entitled to an accounting. There was a hearing on this question and 500 pages of evidence was taken. There was a finding against defendant, an appeal was prosecuted and the decree was affirmed. A long and costly litigation followed, resulting in a decree against defendant. On appeal it was held by the Appellate Court, and is now held by this court, that the amount awarded complainant by the trial court was not in full of what he was entitled to receive. Under these facts we think all of the costs should be charged against defendant.\\nComplainant’s share of the profits is as follows: From September 30, 1918, to January 11, 1919, $925; from January 11, xgxg, to March 11, xgxg, $2521.63; from March 11, xgxg, to July 26, xgxg, $7577-56; from July 26, igig, to November 30, xgxg, $3010; making a total profit of $ 14,034. xg.

Plea, not guilty.\\nIt appears, from the evidence, that in December, 1850, about six o’clock in the evening, the plaintiff was travelling in a wagon, drawn by two horses, near the railroad crossing on the turnpike leading west from Chicago; that the locomotive engine and cars of the defendants were at the same time going towards Chicago, and near the place where the roads cross; that the two roads run nearly parallel for a number of rods before they cross; that the defendants failed to ring a bell or sound a whistle as the train of cars approached the crossing; that the plaintiff drove across the railroad track immediately before and within a few feet of the locomotive; that his horses became frightened at the engine and cars, ran into the railroad ditch, upset the wagon, ran off, and were lost; and that the plaintiff himself was considerably bruised.\\nThe jury returned a verdict of two hundred dollars against the defendants, and the plaintiff had judgment thereon.\\nAt the request of the plaintiff, the court, among other instructions to the jury, gave the following:\\n“ If the jury believe, from the evidence, that the defendants omitted to ring a bell or sound a whistle, in the manner required by law, such omission constitutes a primá facie case of negligence, and the defendants are liable to the plaintiff for the loss and damage proved to have been sustained by him, unless the defendants prove that such loss and damage were not occasioned by such omission.”',\n",

Appellant’s witnesses do not testify in direct and positive terms that he did make such agreement, but after telling of their visit to him shortly after he brought his damage suit against appellant and of certain conversations with him relating to that matter and disposition of the suit if appellant would restore his water supply, gave it as their conclusion or understanding that upon the restoration of the water supply appellee would release appellant from the covenants in the deed requiring it to preserve the spring. We find no satisfactory evidence to justify such conclusions or inferences. Besides, appellee emphatically denies making the agreement. He testified he did not care to collect money from appellant; that what he wanted was his water supply restored and thereafter maintained, and that if appellant had done this he would have been willing to have dismissed his damage suit upon appellant paying the costs and his attorney’s fees. He further testified that the flow of water had never been satisfactorily restored by appellant; that as restored the flow was too small and inadequate. The correspondence between appellant’s representative and appellee’s attorneys after the alleged agreement was made corroborates the testimony of appellee. The language in letters written by some of appellant’s representatives, six months after the alleged agreement was made, express a desire for a better understanding with appellee before appellant does anything more in the case, and inquiry is made of appellee’s counsel if he (appellee) would be willing to execute a release to appellant of its obligation to\",\n",

Almore was later sentenced to an extended term of 12 years’ imprisonment pursuant to section 9 — 3(f) of the Criminal Code of 1961 (Code) (720 ILCS 5/9 — 3(f) (West 2006)). The extended sentence was based on the Cook County circuit court’s finding that defendant and the victim were “family or household members” as that term is defined in section 112A — 3(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (725 ILCS 5/112A — 3(3) (West 2006)).\\nOn appeal, the appellate court affirmed defendant’s conviction, but vacated defendant’s sentence. No. 1 — 08—1459 (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23). The appellate court held that the evidence did not support the trial court’s finding that defendant and the victim were “family or household members” within the meaning of the statute. The matter was remanded to the circuit court for resentencing.\\nWe granted the State’s petition for leave to appeal. The single issue before us is whether the evidence supports the trial court’s finding that defendant and the victim “shared a common dwelling” within the meaning of section 112A — 3(3) and, thus, were “family or household members,” justifying an extended sentence.\\nFor reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the appellate court.\\nBACKGROUND\\nOn the morning of August 23, 2006, Lovia Hampton went to work and left her two-year-old son, Ethan, in the care of her boyfriend, defendant James Almore. Defendant had been Lovia’s boyfriend since November 2004 and on August 23, 2006, Lovia and Ethan had been staying with defendant at his temporary residence at 1228 West 99th Street in Chicago for the previous five days.',\n",

Lovia and Ethan ordinarily lived with Lovia’s mother, siblings, and other extended family in the Hampton family home at 56 West 114th Place in Chicago. Defendant had stayed with Lovia and Ethan in the Hampton home on several occasions. Defendant’s temporary residence was the upstairs apartment in the home of his aunt, Ruby Watkins, at 1228 West 99th Street in Chicago. There, defendant lived with his two cousins, Charles Watkins and Howard Terrell Williams. Watkins and Williams had their own bedrooms, but defendant slept on an air mattress in the living room of the upstairs apartment.\\nWhen Lovia left for work around 7 a.m. that August morning, Ethan was still sleeping. According to defendant, Ethan woke up around 10 a.m. and they played “wrestling” and “boxing” games together. Defendant then left Ethan on the air mattress with a juice box and some powdered doughnuts while defendant went into another room to use a computer. Later, defendant allegedly heard Ethan coughing and returned to the living room. There he found Ethan lying lifelessly on the floor near the air mattress. Defendant also noticed that Ethan had “spit up” on the air mattress.\\nBelieving that Ethan had choked on a doughnut, defendant yelled for his cousin, Williams, and they each attempted the Heimlich maneuver on Ethan. Defendant also called 911 and was given instructions on how to perform cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Defendant and Williams both attempted to perform CPR on Ethan until paramedics arrived.',\n",

They continued to perform CPR on Ethan as they transported him to the hospital. At the hospital, advanced lifesaving measures were taken. Nonetheless, Ethan could not be revived. He was pronounced dead soon after his arrival at the hospital. An autopsy was performed and the medical examiner ruled Ethan’s death a homicide. The autopsy report indicated that Ethan was covered in fresh bruises consistent with abuse and that he had internal injuries which suggested that Ethan had been held against a wall or floor while being punched or kicked. Based on the autopsy report, defendant was charged with first degree murder. In a bench trial, defendant was tried on that charge and convicted.\\nTen days after the court found defendant guilty of murder, the court heard argument on defendant’s post-trial motion for new trial. Based on defense counsel’s argument, the trial court vacated defendant’s murder conviction and, instead, found defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Immediately thereafter, the court proceeded to sentencing. After hearing argument, the court imposed an extended-term sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment based on its finding that the victim and defendant were “household or family members.” See 720 ILCS 5/9 — 3(f) (West 2006).',\n",

The court held that, in order for defendant and Ethan to be “family or household members,” the evidence had to show they “shared a common dwelling” within the meaning of section 112A— 3(3). Relying on People v. Young, 362 Ill. App. 3d 843 (2005), the court interpreted “shared a common dwelling” to mean that the persons in question must have stayed together “on an extended, indefinite, or regular basis.” The court then held the evidence did not show that the victim and defendant “shared a common dwelling” because there was no evidence presented at trial indicating that defendant, the victim, and Hampton stayed together on an extended or regular basis. As a result, the court held the evidence did not support the trial court’s finding that defendant and Ethan were household members within the meaning of section 9 — 3(f) and, thus, the trial court erred when it imposed an extended Class 2 felony sentence.

The decision date is (2011-03-24)\\n\\nStandard of Review\\nThe State contends that the appellate court erred when it vacated the defendant’s extended Class 2 felony sentence because the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, is sufficient to support the trial court’s finding that the victim and defendant shared a common dwelling and, thus, were “household members.” See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979); People v. Siguenza-Brito, 235 Ill. 2d 213, 224 (2009) (when considering issues concerning the sufficiency of the evidence, the standard is whether any rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt). The defendant agrees that this is the proper standard, but argues that the appellate court properly found that the trial court erred because a rational trier of fact could not have concluded from the evidence presented that defendant and Ethan were household members beyond a reasonable doubt.\\nThe State also recognizes, however, that the proper construction of the term “shared a common dwelling” in the statutory definition of “family or household member” is also at issue in this case and whether statutory terms have been construed correctly is a question of law, which is reviewed de novo. People v. Howard, 228 Ill. 2d 428, 432 (2008).\\n“Share a Common Dwelling”\\nSection 112A — 3(3) provides that persons will be deemed “family or household members” if they “share or formerly shared a common dwelling.” In determining what it means to “share a common dwelling,” the appellate court below relied on People v. Young, 362 Ill. App. 3d 843, 849 (2005), wherein the court interpreted the phrase “family or household member” in connection with the domestic battery statute, which also references section 112A — 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.',\n",

The decision date is (2011-03-24)\\n\\nIn Young, the State contended that the defendant was guilty of domestic battery because the defendant and the victim were “family or household members” by virtue of the fact that they “shared a common dwelling” within the meaning of section 112A — 3(3). At trial, evidence was presented which showed that the night before the alleged attack, the defendant and the victim had spent the night in the same “PADS” homeless shelter. The next morning, the defendant and victim left the shelter together and then spent the day together, drinking in a bar. Later that day, when they went to check in at another PADS shelter for the evening, they got into an argument. In the parking lot outside the shelter, the defendant attacked the victim.\\nAt trial, the victim testified that she met the defendant at a PADS shelter about lVz months prior to the attack and that she and the defendant had stayed at various PADS shelters on several occasions since then. The victim denied, however, that she and the defendant were more than social friends, stating that they had been on only one “date” and did not have an ongoing dating relationship.\\nBased on the evidence, the trial court found that the defendant and victim shared a common dwelling and convicted the defendant of domestic battery. The appellate court reversed, however, finding that the evidence did not support a finding that the couple had shared a common dwelling. The appellate court held that “shared lodgings are not a shared dwelling unless the living arrangement has a degree of permanence” and a “dwelling” is where persons stay “on an extended, indefinite, or regular basis.”',\n",

The decision date is (2011-03-24)\\n\\nBased on the reasoning in Young, the appellate court in the case at bar concluded that Ethan and defendant did not share a common dwelling. The appellate court noted that the Young court “recognized the possibility that two people could form a household for the purposes of section 112A — 3(3) ‘by virtue of their consistently lodging together,’ thus creating a nomadic household with no fixed place of residence.” Nevertheless, the court found no shared “common dwelling” in the case at bar because “there was no testimony at trial indicating the defendant, the victim, and Hampton stayed together in one adult’s home on an extended or regular basis.”\\nWhile we agree with the appellate court that the statute does not require a single fixed residence, we do not agree that the evidence in this case does not support a finding that defendant and Ethan shared a common dwelling within the meaning of section 112A — 3(3). As recognized in In re Alexis H., 401 Ill. App. 3d 543, 559-60 (2010), a statute must be interpreted consistent with the purpose and intent of the legislature. When looking at the language used by the legislature to define “family or household member” in paragraph (3) of section 112A — 3, it is clear that the legislature attempted to capture all of the myriad types of “familial” relationships, both past and present, as well as various situations of cohabitation and shared living arrangements. The statutory definition is broad. There can be no bright-line test for determining household membership. Each case must be decided based on its specific facts.',\n",

No particular length of time is required, nor is length of time the dispositive factor. Other factors that may be considered are: the nature of the living arrangements, whether the parties had any other living accommodations; whether they kept personal items at the shared residence; and whether the parties shared in the privileges and duties of a common residence, such as contributing to household expenses or helping with maintenance.

During that time, Ethan and Lovia slept in the same room with defendant and even shared the same air mattress. Some of Ethan’s clothes, food, and medicine were kept at defendant’s residence and Lovia relied on defendant to provide child care for Ethan when she left to go to work. In addition, the evidence established that Lovia and defendant dated for IV2 years, which was most of Ethan’s life. Lovia testified that, on several occasions during that IV2 years, she and defendant resided together either at her family residence or at defendant’s residence. Whenever Lovia stayed at defendant’s residence, Ethan stayed there too. Thus, the five days prior to Ethan’s death was not the only time that Lovia, Ethan and defendant shared a common dwelling, nor was it the first time that Lovia and Ethan stayed at defendant’s residence. Also, Lovia testified that August 23, 2006, was not the only time she left Ethan in defendant’s care.\\nWe hold this evidence is sufficient to support a finding that Lovia, Ethan, and defendant were members of each other’s “household” by virtue of the fact that they shared a common dwelling, even though the “dwelling” was sometimes the Hampton family home and sometimes the residence defendant shared with his relatives.\\nCONCLUSION\\nBased on the totality of the circumstances, we conclude the evidence supports the trial court’s finding that defendant and Ethan shared a common dwelling within the meaning of section 112A — 3(3). Accordingly, we reverse the appellate court judgment and reinstate defendant’s 12-year extended sentence.\\nAppellate court judgment reversed; circuit court judgment affirmed.',\n",

The other two makers of the trust deed were living. They, and appellees as heirs and devisees of their parents, were made parties defendant, served with process, and a default decree was entered against them on September 3, 1936. During the same month, on appellant’s motion, the decree was vacated. By leave of court, the complaint was amended, adding allegations that no inventory was filed in the estate of the parents of appellees within one year from the probate thereof, but was filed in the following year, and that creditors having claims could assert them. ■ Unknown creditors of the decedents, and other parties alleged to claim interests in the premises, were added as defendants. The additional defendants were apparently served with process. They were defaulted and a new decree was entered finding, among other things, that appellant is entitled to recover from appellees, as heirs and devisees of their deceased parents, the value of all assets received by them from the two estates for any deficiency in case the proceeds of the sale were not sufficient to pay the amount of the decree. After the sale, a deficiency decree for $1497.53 was entered on December 17, 1936, -against the living makers of the bonds, with the same holding as to the liability of appellees, limiting it to personal assets received. The original decree made no finding of any liability of appellees.',\n",

The decision date is (1941-04-10)\\n\\nOn May 5, 1938, appellees filed a verified “motion in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis” to vacate all the proceedings subsequent to the granting of leave to amend, and asking leave to plead or answer. This puts the motion under section 72 of the Civil Practice act, supra. The motion sets up that all the proceedings were without notice to anyone; that appellees had no knowledge thereof until April, 1938, and that they had paid out more for the estates than they had received. The motion was denied. On appeal, the Appellate Court held that section 72 applies to chancery proceedings, reversed the order and remanded the cause, with directions to permit appellees to answer the complaint as amended. We dismissed a petition for leave to appeal for want of a final judgment. Under the mandates, the trial court entered an order vacating the second decree and granted appellees leave to plead or answer. On a second appeal, the Appellate Court held the order appealed from was not final and dismissed the appeal. The first decision of the Appellate Court was not final and was not reviewable by this court. While the Appellate Court deemed that decision was binding upon it on the second appeal, it is not binding on this court in reviewing the latter decision. (Stripe v. Yager, 348 Ill. 362; McLaughlin v. Hahn, 333 id. 83.) Counsel for appellees confuse the character of the judgment of the Appellate Court on the first appeal with that of the subsequent order of the superior court vacating the decree of foreclosure. The Appellate Court fell into the same error. Appellant suggests, and we agree with him, that if there was no final order until the decree was vacated, when it was subsequently vacated the vacating order is a final order. (Mitchell v. King, 187 Ill. 452; Cramer v. Illinois Commercial Men’s Assn. 260 id. 516; Central Bond and Mortgage Co. v. Roeser, 323 id. 90; People v. Green, 355 id. 468.)

The decision date is (1941-04-10)\\n\\nThis brings up for consideration the question of whether section 72 of the Civil Practice act applies to chancery proceedings. The question resolves itself into a determination of whether the Civil Practice act- abolishes all distinctions between actions at law and in chancery. At common law, and in this State prior to the enactment of the Civil Practice act, a motion in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis could be employed only as to judgments at law. (1 Bouvier, 681; Tosetti Brewing Co. v. Koehler, 200 Ill. 369.) In the Tosetti case, a decree was set aside on motion after the term and another decree was entered which was reversed by the Appellate Court whose judgment we affirmed. In that case this court said: “In an action at law the statute abolishing the writ of error coram nobis and substituting therefor a motion, authorizes the court to set aside a judgment at any time within five years, for an error of fact that came within the scope of the writ as it existed at common law. * * * The statutory motion does not apply to cases in chancery. * * * The proper method of impeaching and setting aside a decree after the term is to file an original bill in the nature of a bill of review, when such decree may be set aside, reversed or modified, according to the equities of the parties.” We reaffirmed this holding in Madison and Kedzie State Bank v. Cicero-Chicago Corrugating Co. 351 Ill. 180, Wilson v. Fisher, 369 id. 538, and Harris v. Chicago House Wrecking Co. 314 id. 500. In Jacobson v. Ashkinaze, 337 Ill. 141, we held the essentials of the proceeding under the statute are the same as they were at common law.',\n",

The material part of section 1 reads: “The provisions of this act shall apply to all civil proceedings, both at law and in equity, unless their application is otherwise herein expressly limited. * * * As to all matters not regulated by statute or rule of court, the practice at common law and in equity shall prevail.” Section 31 provides: “Neither the names heretofore used to distinguish the different ordinary actions at law, nor any formal requisites heretofore appertaining to the manner of pleading in such actions respectively, shall hereafter be deemed necessary or appropriate, and there shall be no distinctions respecting the manner of pleading between such actions at law and suits in equity, other than those specified in this act and the rules adopted pursuant thereto; but this section shall not be deemed to affect in any way the substantial averments of fact necessary to state any cause of action either at law or in equity.” Section 44 (1) provides that subject to rules plaintiffs may join “any causes of action, whether legal or equitable or both.” The second paragraph of that section provides that “any cause of action or counter-claim may be transferred at any time, by order of the court, from the law docket to the equity docket, or vice versa, as convenience and the nature of such action or counter-claim may require, and when so transferred shall proceed as though commenced on the proper side of the court; and any issue may at any time, by order of the court, be transferred for trial to the proper side of the court.” These provisions demonstrate it was not the legislative intent to abolish substantive distinctions.

The provisions of section 44 clarify the general provisions of sections 1 and 31 in this respect. Presumably the legislature knew that the constitutional requirement of trial by jury in actions at law necessitates a distinction between legal and equitable proceedings, and we may assume that fact was taken into consideration when the statute was enacted.

It provides: “The writ of error coram nobis is hereby abolished, and all errors in fact, committed in the proceedings of any court of record, and which, by the common law, could have been corrected by said writ, may be corrected by the court in which the error was committed, upon motion in writing, made at any time within five years after the rendition of final judgment in the case, upon reasonable notice. When the person entitled to make such motion shall be an infant, non compos mentis or under duress, at the time of passing judgment, the time of such disability shall be excluded from the computation of said five years.” It is to be noticed that this section applies only to errors of fact which, by the common, law, could be corrected by the writ. Such errors were confined to errors in actions at law. That the legislature recognized this is evident from the fact that the section mentions only “judgments” and makes no provision as to orders or decrees.',\n",

Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway Co. 306 id. 459.) The provisions of section 72 of the Civil Practice act and of section 3 of the Judgments act are specific in their application to the question in issue. The well-settled rule of statutory construction is that where there is found in a statute a particular enactment, it is held to be operative as against the general provisions on the subject either in the same act or in the general laws relating thereto. (Robbins v. Comrs. of Lincoln Park, 332 Ill. 571; Handtoffski v. Chicago Consolidated Traction Co. 274 id. 282.)

This suit was begun on April 22, 1898. The original' declaration, of one count, was filed on May 7, 1898, and charged that the defendant was the owner of a certain barn, known as the Lincoln avenue car barn; that said barn was supplied with switches, turn-tables and appliances for turning about, reversing and removing cars from the main line; that a certain car was moving along the main line of the defendant in said barn and that the plaintiff was switching another car from said main track, and the first mentioned car collided with the car which he was switching, striking the rear end of the same and injuring him while he was in the act of applying the brake to the car. The negligence charged was, that defendant failed to furnish plaintiff sufficient assistance to enable him to properly perform his duties, and that' the' grip-man in charge of the cable train was incompetent to perform his duties, and negligently propelled and ran the cable car against the plaintiff while the plaintiff was in the exercise of ordinary care. A demurrer was sustained to this declaration, and on June 22, 1898, within two years after the accident, plaintiff filed an amended declaration of one count, alleging that he was in defendant’s employ as a groom, and while handling the car in question, and while in the exercise of ordinary care, the defendant, through its servants, negligently and carelessly ran another cable train upon and into the car upon which he was, thereby injuring him. To this amended count the defendant pleaded the general issue.\",\n",

The second additional count charged that the defendant caused the plaintiff to remain and continue in said employment, promising that it would within a reasonable time supply him with additional assistance or help in starting the cars, and that, acting under the immediate direction of said defendant, and without any person to assist in switching the cars, plaintiff, while in the exercise of ordinary care, was injured by reason of said negligence.\\nOn February 5, 1901, plaintiff filed two other additional counts, the first of which alleged that he complained and notified the defendant that he was not supplied with any help or assistance in switching cars over said loop, and that the switching of said cars without help was highly dangerous; that it promised to furnish additional assistance within a reasonable time, and plaintiff, relying upon said promise, continued to operate said cars and was injured. The second additional count is substantially like the preceding one.\\nTo these additional counts of January 17 and February 5 the defendant filed a plea of the Statute of Limitations, to which plaintiff demurred, and the demurrer was sustained.

But it is insisted by appellant that whether any of the additional counts are simply a re-statement of the cause of action alleged in the declaration filed within two years, or whether all of such counts state an entirely new cause of action, must be determined by a comparison of the additional counts with the amended declaration filed June 22, 1898; that they cannot be compared with the original declaration of May 7, 1898, for the reason that a demurrer was sustained to that declaration, and is not, as is said, now in the case, and is not a sufficient basis for the additional counts; also, that the amended declaration of June 22, 1898, did not state a cause of action and was fatally defective on motion in arrest of judgment, and therefore it cannot be the basis of additional counts. In determining this last question there must be a distinction made between a defective cause of action and the statement of a cause of action in a defective manner. If it is a wholly defective cause of action it cannot be made a sufficient basis for additional counts filed after the expiration of two years; but if the original declaration, and the amendments thereto, were merely the statement of a cause of action in a defective manner, they would be a sufficient basis for such additional counts.',\n",

       " {'text': 'The name of the case is The North Chicago Street Railroad Company v. Joseph Aufmann. The decision date is (1906-06-14)\\n\\nThe amended declaration filed on June 22 alleged the incompetency or negligence of those in charge of the cable train, and it is insisted by appellant that the recovery was not upon that ground, but for failing to furnish sufficient help, and therefore the additional counts filed after the expiration of two years were barred unless the original declaration could be madfe the basis for filing them. We are of the opinion that the allegation of the original declaration as to the failure of appellant to furnish necessary help was a sufficient basis for the allegations of the additional counts. The Statute of Limitations requiring a suit for a personal injury to be brought within two years does not apply to matters of pleading, and should not be given that effect indirectly by holding that an imperfect statement of a cause of action is no statement at all. In the case of Chicago City Railway Co. v. Hackendahl, 188 Ill. 300, we said (p. 304) : “It has never been held by this court that a re-statement, in a more perfect manner, of a cause of action in an amended declaration can be regarded as the beginning of the suit on such cause of action. As a general rule, the very purpose of an amended declaration is to state in a more accurate and legal manner than it had been previously stated, the cause of action for which the suit was brought, and if the rule contended for by appellant were adopted no declaration could be amended in any substantial respect after the time limited by the statute for bringing the suit had run. The Statute of Limitations does not apply to matters of mere pleading, and it should not be given that effect indirectly by holding that an imperfect statement of a cause of action is no statement of it. In Eylenfeldt v. Illinois Steel Co. 165 Ill. 185, no cause of action whatever was stated in the original declaration, and it was held that the statute was properly pleaded to the amended declaration, which set up a good cause of action after the statute had',\n",

If the cause of action, whether perfectly or imperfectly stated in the original declaration, had been abandoned and a new cause of action had been stated in the amended declaration in this case the plea would have been good; or if not abandoned, the plea would hav.e been good as to any new cause set up after the running of the statute. (Phelps v. Illinois Central Railroad Co. 94 Ill. 548.) There was no error in sustaining the demurrer to the plea.” And so here, if the additional counts filed after the expiration of the two years had stated some other causes of negligence than those charged in the .original declaration or the amended declaration then there would be force in appellant’s contention, but as the original declaration and all additional counts charged either the negligent operation of the cars or the want of sufficient help as the cause of the accident, we are of the opinion that the court did not err in sustaining the demurrer to the plea.',\n",

It is insisted that no count in the declaration avers that the plaintiff did not know, or in the exercise of ordinary care could not have known, of the risk which caused the accident,—in other words, that he did not negative the assumption of risk. It is also insisted that the instruction is in conflict with the decision of this court in Illinois Terra Cotta Lumber Co. v. Hanley, 214 Ill. 243. But the facts in that case are unlike the facts in the present case. In the case at bar the allegation of the declaration is, that while appellee was engaged in switching cars over said loop and acting under the immediate direction of said defendant, etc., “said defendant carelessly and negligently ordered the plaintiff to switch said cars over said loop to their place of destination without the assistance of said servant or without any help or assistance.” We have held that where a servant is acting under the orders of the master in the performance of dangerous work, or is doing dangerous work under promise on the part of the master to furnish him a safe place or a sufficient number of servants, the servant is relieved from the assumption of risks incident to the work he is doing, and is only precluded from recovering, under the above circumstances, where the danger is so imminent that no man of ordinary prudence would engage in the work.

He was in an intoxicated condition, and soon after coming into the room vomited upon the floor, and, without going into details, we may say his condition and conduct was such as to justify his expulsion from the room.\\nMoffett, who was a crippled and lamed man, had before that been appointed deputy sheriff, for the purpose of clothing him with authority to preserve order in the depot, and he carried an officer’s “ billy.” He attempted to eject Randolph, who resisted, and a struggle ensued.\\nWe need not here refer to what occurred in the course of the struggle in the room, further than to say we have carefully read the testimony relating to it, and that it does not appear Moffett used more force than was proper and necessary to remove Randolph from the room, and that in so doing the latter did not receive any injury for which it can be seriously claimed the judgment can be sustained.',\n",

Morris, one of the plaintiffs in error. The land was conveyed, subject to the mortgage, for a consideration of $25, and whatever might be realized under a contemporaneous written agreement, whereby Jane W. Morris was authorized to resist the foreclosure of said mortgage on the ground of fraud, and was obligated to give Sarah Ellen Bates one half of the net proceeds of any reduction which might be obtained by resisting, defending or compromising.\\nThere is no doubt that the note and mortgage were bought by Lucinda Park in good faith, and for a valuable consideration, and without notice of any defense thereto.

This is a highly improbable story, to say the least, and the chancellor would have been justified in disbelieving it, even if Montray had not contradicted it.

On this subject, the latter says at one time, “ I will swear it on a pile of bibles as high as a man can stand,” and at another time, “ I will swear that forty times more.” When this witness was asked if he and his wife were not living separate and apart at the time of her suit against Montray, he prevaricated shamefully, and then, after an adjournment for dinner, took the witness stand and swore that he and his wife were living separate and apart at that time, and explained his prevarication in the following language : <k I saw very plainly what he (defendant in-error’s attorney) wanted when he began to ask me— what he was driving at—but I had not thought about what to say.” This amounted to a confession that he was endeavoring to swear according to his interests, and that he would not commit himself before ascertaining what his interests were. These are but a few of the facts connected with this case which show the unreliability of the testimony. of David L. Bates. Sarah Ellen Bates gave her testimony with less recklessness than did her husband. But the story was the same and its inherent improbability was sufficient to condemn it and to justify the court in rejecting it.\\nThe evidence shows a full settlement between Mary Ellen Bates and Jasper I.

Plaintiff was riding in an automobile as a passenger at the time. The automobile in which plaintiff was riding was backed from the east side of the street across the tracks of defendant company. From the evidence offered on behalf of the plaintiff it was indicated that the automobile was first stopped at the sidewalk, at which time both plaintiff and the driver looked in both directions for oncoming interurban cars. They saw none approaching and the driver then backed across the paved portion of the street and upon the dirt portion where the tracks were located and stopped the automobile so that the rear of the automobile was across the nearest streetcar track and the front of the automobile was near the paved portion of the street. While the automobile was so parked waiting for traffic to clear on the paved portion of the street so that the automobile could be driven in a northerly direction, the driver and plaintiff testified they looked again for approaching interurban cars but saw none coming. The evidence indicated that from the position in which they were parked their vision to the south was partially obstructed by a row of poles supporting a trolley wire adjacent to the track, and also that the track curves some 200 to 300 feet south of the place where the automobile was situated so that they could not have a clear view all the way down the track. After they had been parked in such position for some time plaintiff testified his attention was directed to an approaching interurban car by hearing a tingling of the rails. He then warned the driver of the approach of the interurban car and endeavored to open the automobile door to get out, but the automobile was struck by the interurban car before he had time to escape.

The automobile was pushed by the interurban car for some distance, indicated by plaintiff’s witnesses to be about 190 feet. The speed of the oncoming interurban car was estimated by plaintiff to be between 40 to 50 miles per hour.

The decision date is (1955-02-01)\\n\\nIt is apparent that on the issues of fact the evidence was in direct conflict. Conflicting questions of fact such as speed, distance, and questions of contributory negligence, where the facts were in dispute, are questions of fact for the jury to determine (Loftus v. Chicago Rys. Co., 293 Ill. 475).\\nThe determination of whether or not the defendant was negligent under the record in this case was a question of fact for the jury, in view of the evidence as to the speed of the interurban car and the distance the automobile was pushed after the collision (Chicago City Ry. Co. v. Tuohy, 196 Ill. 410). Similarly, plaintiff could not be held to be contributorily negligent, as a matter of law, under the evidence. Plaintiff was not in control of the operation of the automobile, but was riding in it as a guest. His testimony as to what he did and said raised a question of fact for the jury, and it was for the jury to determine whether or not he was then and there in the exercise of due care for his own safety.\\nIn view of the fact that the interurban car was traveling along a track within the municipality, so-called railroad crossing cases on the subject of contributory negligence of a passenger in an automobile would not be applicable, and the distinction pointed out in Pienta v. Chicago City Ry. Co., 284 Ill. 246, applies. In that case it is pointed out (at page 259) that the reasoning in cases as to the care necessary in approaching a highway crossing of a steam railroad in the country is quite different from that of an electric car running along a public highway or street in a thickly settled locality. The court pointed out that in one case there is a completely unobstructed view of approaching objects; that within the city limits, on the contrary, the degree of care required of the motorman of the electric car would be greater than that of the engineer of a steam engine out in the open countryside.',\n",

Rockford & Interurban Ry. Co., 305 Ill. 339; Bolen v. Central Ill. Public Service Co., 237 Ill. App. 226). Under the record in this cause, with conflicting evidence on the question of negligence of defendant and on the question of due care of plaintiff, this court on appeal could not substitute its judgment for that of the jury-in determining such questions of fact (Martin v. Village of Patoka, 305 Ill. App. 51).\\nPlaintiff in this case sustained permanent and serious injuries which will prevent his doing extensive physical labor for the remainder of his life. Physical labor is the only type of work for which plaintiff possesses any qualifications. The expectancy (of sixteen years) of plaintiff, his medical expense, coupled with his pain and suffering, are sufficient to sustain the verdiet of $30,000. Under the record in this cause such verdict cannot be determined to be excessive so as to justify modification or reversal, nor can this court conclude that the verdict resulted from passion or prejudice.',\n",

In connection with the inquiry of the juror, in the preliminary examination a juror was asked whether he had been on the jury the previous week, and then the question was put, “You didn’t give all the money away?” Counsel for defendant voiced an objection to the remark but there was no ruling upon it. Where the record fails to show a ruling upon an objection it is deemed to be waived and cannot be raised upon appeal (Grarshon v. Aaron, 330 Ill. App. 540). After such examination, and out of the presence of the jury, an amendment raising the ad damnum was made. The right to amendment of such pleadings was consistent with the provisions of the Civil Practice Act (1953 Illinois Revised Statutes, chapter 110, section 170 [Jones Ill. Stats. Ann. 104.046]), and the allowance of such amendment was discretionary with the trial court and did not warrant a mistrial.\\nDefendant also contends that the court below erred in the giving of certain instructions. It is contended that one instruction was peremptory in that it fails to limit the negligence referred to in the instruction to that charged in the complaint. It was a frequently- used stock instruction correctly setting forth an abstract legal relationship and referring to the fact that if the jury believed from the evidence and instructions that if such were the case plaintiff “would be entitled to recover.” The instruction was not peremptory in the sense that it told the jury that if certain facts were proven a verdict should be returned for the plaintiff (Goldberg v. Capitol Freight Lines, 382 Ill. 283). The giving of such instruction, in view of the other instructions given and the language set forth in it was not improper (Goldberg v. Capitol Freight Lines, supra; Murphy v. Ill. State Trust Co., 375 Ill. 310).',\n",

The courts of this State have approved such instructions in the form in which they were given (Tennes v. Tennes, 320 Ill. App. 19). Defendant gave many instructions which instructed the jury quite at length on the various issues of law in the case. Plaintiff gave only a few. Under the record before us, after reviewing all the instructions given and reading the instructions as a series, it is obvious that there was no basis for reversal in the instructions given on behalf of plaintiff.\\nWe must therefore conclude on the record in this cause that there was no reversible error and that the judgment of the circuit court of Madison county should be affirmed.\\nJudgment affirmed.\\nBARDENS and SCHEINEMAN, JJ., concur.',\n",

Haple, and against Hitler.\\nPrior to the commencement of the suit Hitler had been a merchant at Peoria, and as such had handled a great deal of appellee’s goods. Some he had bought- outright and others he had taken upon consignment. The suit was brought to recover those goods which appellee claimed he held by consignment. Upon a trial by the court, a jury being waived, there was a judgment rendered in favor of appellee for the possession of the goods and costs.\\nThe contract under which the goods in controversy were shipped to Hitler was arranged entirely by correspondence. We gather from the various letters which passed between the parties that it was intended and understood by them that the goods were to be regarded as distinct from other goods shipped (which were really sold to Hitler), and were to be treated as consigned goods with title to remain in appellee until sold by Hitler. The latter received them under instructions to keep account of sales and report monthly. He was to report on the first of each month all sales of goods made the month before, upon the receipt of which a bill for the goods sold would be rendered payable on the 15th day of the following month. By such an arrangement appellee did not part with its title to the goods when shipped, and was not estopped from asserting its ownership to such as were unsold, as against judgment creditors of Hitler.\",\n",

There is no evidence tending to show that appellee so treated them. The representations of Hitler made without the knowledge or consent of appellee could not prejudice its rights. Proof of such representations by Hitler were properly rejected by the Circuit Court. It is a cardinal principle of the law of personal property that no man can .be divested of it without his consent.

The decision date is (1947-04-18)\\n\\nA petition for instructions submitted by a trustee in a bona fide attempt to construe the instrument which established the trust is a recognized procedure honored by the courts. (Conlan v. Sullivan, 280 Ill. App. 332.) In the instant case, the trustee was confronted with interpreting the provisions in the consent decree of September 19, 1945 which referred to Edward B. Hayes as the solicitor of Sidney Baldwin and directed that he receipt payments of income, in the light of the notification that Edward B. Hayes had been discharged. This problem was further complicated by the provision in the will of Fannie Gr. Baldwin prohibiting the beneficiaries from assigning any part of their interests in the estate. Clearly, under these circumstances, there was ample justification for the filing of a petition for instructions.\\nIn determining the propriety of the findings of the court in the hearing on this petition, it is apparent that a client may dismiss an attorney at any time, with or without cause, for the client is entitled to be represented by an attorney in whose ability and fidelity he has confidence. (Conlan v. Sullivan, supra; Doggett v. Deauville Corp., 148 F. (2d) 881; Almon v. American Carloading Corp., 380 Ill. 524.) \"Where, however, the attorney has been guilty of no misconduct, the courts may require the payment of fair compensation for his services. (124 A. L. R. 725, note; 5 Am. Jur. p. 284.)\\nIn the case under consideration, therefore, Sidney Baldwin would properly be entitled to discharge the respondent, Edward B. Hayes, and the order of the court recognizing the termination of his services with reference to this trust would be in accordance with the law, unless anything contained in the decree of September 19, 1945 barred his discharge from this cause.',\n",

The decision date is (1947-04-18)\\n\\nOne of the fundamental canons of judicial construction is that a decree must be interpreted in its entirety. The decree of September 19, 1945 specifically confirmed the will, and recited that the parties agreed to abide by its terms. Under Item V, par. 16 of the will, a spendthrift trust is established whereby the beneficiaries are prohibited from assigning their respective interests in the estate. Therefore, respondent’s contention that the receipt provision granted him an interest in the estate is in direct conflict with this provision of the will. The receipt clause, furthermore, by its own terms, recognizes that receipts may be given by attorneys other than those named therein, and enumerates several obvious contingencies for such changes. Of even greater significance, however, is the fact that in the proceeding which culminated in the decree of September 19, 1945, the respondent Edward B. Hayes had no claim for fees or of any other nature against the estate or against the beneficiary. He was neither a party nor had any rights which were adjudicated therein. He merely acted as attorney of record for Sidney Baldwin and was referred to as such in this provision of the decree.\\nThis is not a case where a party to a consent decree is endeavoring to review the decree and breach the contract sanctioned by the court. (Bergman v. Rhodes, 334 Ill. 137.) Respondent Hayes was not a party to the consent decree. He had no rights determined in that proceeding. The mere reference to him as the solicitor of one of the beneficiaries cannot be construed as gratuitously granting him an interminable interest in the income from the estate accruing to the beneficiaries under the will of Fannie G-. Baldwin in direct violation of other provisions of that will. The only logical interpretation of the words “Edward B. Hayes, her solicitor” in the receipt provision is that they are words of description and identification.',\n",

The decision date is (1947-04-18)\\n\\nThe respondent Hayes has cited numerous cases in support of his contention, none of which appear to be determinative of the issue presented herein. In Doggett v. Deauville Corp., 148 F. (2d) 881, where an attorney who had been discharged from the case appealed from a dismissal of the action by his former client, the court upheld his right to appeal on the ground that upon his discharge the lower court in a hearing for substitution of attorneys determined that his fee could be subsequently asserted as a lien on anything recovered in the action. The court held, however, that although he had a right to appeal, since the matter of his fees had become an issue in the cause, nevertheless, it was proper for the court to direct that the matter of the attorney’s compensation under his contract should be determined in a plenary suit against his client. The court stated, moreover, at p. 882, “It is everywhere recognized that a client may dismiss his attorney at any time with or without cause.” This rule is qualified only by the practice that a court may require as a condition of replacement the payment of fair compensation to the attorney. This decision is clearly consistent with the Illinois cases and with the weight of authority. (Conlan v. Sullivan, supra; 124 A. L. R. 725; 6 Corpus Juris 676-8.)',\n",

The decision date is (1947-04-18)\\n\\nIn the instant case, there is no question of the respondent being deprived of his fees as in the Doggett case, supra. The decree of September 19, 1945 made no reference to the matter of fees nor were there any other rights of the respondent determined in that proceeding. In the hearing on the petition for instructions by the trustee, from which this appeal is prosecuted, the court gave the respondent every opportunity to assert whatever claims he may have had against the estate or against the beneficiary, but none were made, nor was any evidence offered with reference thereto. It is readily apparent, therefore, that the Doggett case is not an authority to sustain respondent’s contention either on its facts or with reference to the rule of law promulgated therein.\\nBoth the petitioner and the respondent Edward B. Hayes have cited the case of Almon v. American Carloading Corp., 380 Ill. 524, in support of their respective arguments. In that case, plaintiffs objected to defendant’s counsel, and an interlocutory order was entered directing the attorney to discontinue as counsel in the proceeding. From this order, defendants and the attorney appealed. The court held that the attorney was not entitled to prosecute an appeal from this interlocutory order, but stated that one not a party of record but merely an attorney in a cause may, under some circumstances, review a decree or judgment. His interest, however, must appear in the record, and that interest must be such as to make it appear that he takes or loses something directly by the judgment or decree he challenges.',\n",

Baldwin as to prevent him from thereafter being discharged. Therefore, there is nothing contained in the Alm.on case which can be construed as establishing a criteria for the disposition of the instant cause. Nor is there anything contained in Bradshaw v. Lucas, 214 Ill. App. 218, relied upon by the respondent, to constitute a precedent herein. In that case a beneficiary of a spendthrift trust was adjudged incompetent, and a conservator was appointed. The latter demanded an accounting from the trustee, and in a consent decree the court ordered that the trustee pay the conservator specified sums for the support of the incompetent beneficiary. Thereafter, the beneficiary filed a petition in his own name, and asked for a guardian ad litem to be\" appointed, and prayed further that the trustee pay the money directly to him. The court held that inasmuch as the beneficiary was adjudged to be incompetent, the trustee must deal with the conservator, for an incompetent has no legal power to act for himself. It appears that the court rejected the beneficiary’s petition for payments to be made to himself, not because of the prior consent decree, but because the beneficiary was legally incompetent.',\n",

The decision date is (1942-05-13)\\n\\nMr. Justice Wilson\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nThe controlling issue presented for decision by this appeal is whether an oil and gas lease to 40 acres of land in Clay county, executed by Mary Ellen and Leo C. Eastin to Leon Pommier on February 19, 1941, and recorded March 3, 1941, is superior to an instrument denominated “Sale of Oil and Gas Royalty,” executed by the same grantors to Earl Abner Reed and his wife, Helen S. Reed, on February 24, 1941, and placed of record the next day. Disposition of this question is, in turn, dependent upon whether Reed, on February 24, 1941, as a matter of fact, had actual notice of the lease or knowledge of such facts and circumstances as would put a reasonable man on inquiry. March 24, 1941, plaintiffs, Reed and his wife, filed their complaint in the circuit court of Clay county seeking the removal of the lease as a cloud upon the interests conveyed to them. The principal defendant, the National Refining Company, assignee of the lease, answered the original, the amended, and the supplemental complaint, averring that any rights which might have been acquired by plaintiffs were subject to the lease and consisted only of an undivided one-half interest to the one-eighth royalty reserved by the grantors under the lease to Pommier. The other defendants, Mary Ellen and Leo C. Eastin, did not interpose an answer. Evidence was heard, and the chancellor found that at the time of the execution of the instrument captioned “Sale of Oil and Gas Royalty” on February 24, 1941, plaintiffs had actual notice of the prior execution of the lease to Pommier, that the later instrument was subject to all the terms and conditions of the lease and that, consequently, plaintiffs were not entitled to the relief sought. A decree was rendered dismissing the amended complaint, as supplemented, for the want of equity. Plaintiffs prosecute a direct appeal, a freehold being necessarily involved.',\n",

The decision date is (1942-05-13)\\n\\nFrom the pleadings and the evidence adduced the following pertinent facts and circumstances appear: February 19, 1941, Mary Ellen Eastin owned the 40 acres in controversy. On the day named, she and her husband, Leo, executed and delivered to Pommier an oil and gas lease upon the entire tract. The signatures of the grantors were acknowledged before Lon S. Tolliver, a notary public. Pommier accompanied Eastin to the residence of Barry Franklin who executed a like lease to Pommier. The two leases were then taken to the Clay City Banking Company at Clay City where they were deposited with J. E. Gibbs, an officer of the bank. Pommier instructed Gibbs to hold the lease from Mrs. Eastin and her husband fifteen days pending a title search. Eastin assented to this arrangement, the understanding being that if the abstract of title was satisfactory and Pommier deposited the agreed price of $80 within fifteen days, Pommier was to be entitled to the possession and enjoyment of the lease. Gibbs wrote out the terms of the instructions given him on an envelope in which he placed the lease. His notation follows: “Lease and contract — for 40 acres — Rate of 2.00 per acre to be paid within 15 days from this date or Lease and contract forfeited to Mary Ellen Eastin and Leo Eastin.” Pommier, it is admitted, was acting in behalf of the National Refining Company. The latter obtained an abstract of title, caused it to be examined by its attorneys, and on March 3, 1941,— within the prescribed period of fifteen days, — deposited $80 to the account of Mary Ellen and Leo C. Eastin in the Clay City Banking Company and the lease was given to Pommier. Thereafter, on March 3, 1941, the oil and gas lease was recorded. Later, on March 4, Pommier and his wife assigned the oil and gas lease to the National Refining Company. The assignment was recorded March 5.

The assignment was recorded March 5. In the méantime, on February 24, 1941, Reed and his wife, accompanied by Tolliver, called upon Mrs. Eastin and her husband at their home for the purpose of purchasing from them a portion of their oil and gas royalty interest. Reed, it appears, has been engaged in the oil business about thirty years, and was familiar with various types of oil and gas conveyances. Tolliver had assisted Reed in taking leases in the vicinity, and had acted as notary public for Reed in other transactions. Indeed, Tolliver had previously attempted, on behalf of Reed, to obtain a lease from Eastin. From Reed’s testimon}'- it appears that in the course of the negotiations on February 24, in response to a query, Eastin answered he did not know whether the tract of 40 acres was leased, adding “I gave another fellow fifteen days to take it or leave it.” Reed testified that upon being advised Eastin received no payment, he said: “If that is all there is to it, that would not make any difference to me about buying the royalty and would not stop you from proceeding.” Eastin’s testimony is to the same effect. According to Reed, he thought Eastin had merely given his word to someone that he would only have fifteen days to come back and accept the lease, stating he was sure that when this proposed lessee returned for a lease and found the grantors had sold their oil and gas rights, he would pursue the usual procedure and refuse to take a lease. The result of the meeting on February 24 was that a price of $300 was agreed upon and paid for one-half the royalty, and Mrs. Eastin and her husband executed the instrument described as “Sale of Oil and Gas Royalty,” conveying an undivided one-half interest in and to all of the oil and gas in or under the tract of 40 acres, the conveyance being made subject to any valid and subsisting oil and gas lease on the land.

The next day, namely, February 25, 1941, as recounted, Reed caused the instrument to him to be duly recorded. Upon, the trial, Reed disclaimed knowledge of the lease. Eastin testified that neither he nor his wife mentioned the fact that their land had already been leased for oil. Mrs. Eastin said she did not tell Reed of the execution of the lease because he never asked about it. Tolliver asserted that “not a word” was uttered by anyone in his presence about the lease, explaining that he remained silent as “I presumed at that time it was Mr. Eastin’s business, not mine.” Reed stated that before departing Eastin inquired whether he (Reed) would pay three dollars an acre for the lease on the property in the event the other party (Pommier) did not come back. Reed replied in the affirmative, saying, “Yes, I would rather have your lease than this royalty.” Thereupon, Eastin advised Reed that the other, party had fifteen days to take the lease out of the bank, his time expiring March 6, and Reed replied that he would return on March y. According to Reed, he first learned of the existence of the lease on March i, 1941. He testified that he communicated with Eastin and asked why the latter did not disclose\" the execution of the lease at the time of the sale of the oil and gas rights on February 24, and that Eastin replied, “You did not ask me.”',\n",

On March 4, 1941, Tolliver made an affidavit that when he took the acknowledgments of the grantors on February 24, they told Reed about the prior oil and gas lease and also informed him that the oil and gas royalty conveyance of February 24 was made subject to the lease of February 19, and, further, that they told Reed the lease was a valid and subsisting oil and gas lease on the property covered by the royalty conveyance. Similarly, on March 5, 1941, Mary Ellen and Leo Eastin signed an affidavit reciting that on the day of the sale and conveyance of the oil and gas royalty on February 24, they advised Reed they had already made and entered into a valid and subsisting oil and gas lease on February 19 to Pommier, and that the conveyance was made subject to the lease. By an affidavit executed on March 7, 1941, Tolliver declared that neither Eastin nor his wife, during the negotiations on February 24, gave Reed or the latter’s wife notice they had theretofore signed and acknowledged an oil and gas lease, and, further, that he did not inform the grantees the grantors had executed a “proposed” oil and gas lease until several days thereafter. Subsequently, on March 15, Mrs. Eastin and her husband executed another affidavit stating that they did not comprehend the meaning of the contents or the purpose for which their earlier affidavit was obtained; that they signed it solely because an attorney of their own choice advised them (1) it was all right and (2) its only meaning was that the oil and gas lease described therein was dated February 19, 1941, and the date of the conveyance to Reed and his wife was February 24, 1941, and that they did not give Reed or his wife any notice whatsoever there was any oil and gas lease outstanding on their land.

The decision date is (1942-05-13)\\n\\nThe legal principles applicable to the present factual situation are firmly settled. Section 30 of the Conveyances act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1941, chap. 30, par. 29, p. 763) ordains: “All deeds, mortgages and other instruments of writing which are authorized to be recorded, shall take effect and be in force from and after the time of filing the same for record, and not before, as to all creditors and subsequent purchasers, without notice; and all such deeds and title papers shall be adjudged void as to all such creditors and subsequent purchasers, without notice, until the same shall be filed for record.” Public records of conveyances and instruments affecting the title to real estate are established by statute to furnish evidence of such title, and a purchaser may rely upon such records in security unless he has notice, or is chargeable in some way with notice, of a claim, estate or interest inconsistent therewith. (Marsh v. Stover, 363 Ill. 490; Bullard v. Turner, 357 id. 279.) It has long been recognized, however, that the statute gives a priority to the deed first recorded only where the grantee of the recorded deed has acted fairly and in good faith. (Struve v. Tatge, 285 Ill. 103; Ryder v. Rush, 102 id. 338; McConnel v. Reed, 4 Scam. 117.) A subsequent purchaser who has notice before he buys a particular parcel that a deed has been executed to another person is bound by the former deed even though his own deed be recorded first. (Struve v. Tatge, supra; Stokes v. Riley, 121 Ill. 166; Morrison v. Kelly, 22 id. 609.) Again, one having notice of facts which would put a prudent man on inquiry is chargeable with knowledge of other facts which he might have discovered by diligent inquiry. Whatever is notice' enough to excite attention and put the party on his guard is notice of everything to which such inquiry might have led and every unusual circumstance is a ground of suspicion and demands investigation.

The foregoing and other circumstances, including the affidavits voluntarily executed by Tolliver, Mary Ellen and Leo Eastin on March 4 and 5, as well as the later affidavits seeking to repudiate their earlier statements on the matter of notice, admit of but one conclusion, namely, that, on February 24, Reed either had actual knowledge of the execution of the oil and gas lease of February 19, or, in any event, was well aware of facts reasonably tending to excite suspicion and which were sufficient to put him upon further inquiry. In our opinion, the evidence amply sustains the conclusion of the chancellor that the defendant National Refining Company sustained its burden of proving notice on the part of plaintiffs.',\n",

The Statute of Frauds was not even mentioned in plaintiffs’ successive pleadings.

The decision date is (1991-02-07)\\n\\nPRESIDING JUSTICE LUND\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nFollowing a bench trial in the circuit court of Livingston County, defendant Roger Waldron was convicted of the offense of driving while license revoked (DWR) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 951/2, par. 6 — 303) and was thereafter sentenced to a term of 364 days’ imprisonment. Defendant appealed, and this court reversed and remanded the judgment of the trial court. (People v. Waldron (4th Dist. 1989), No. 4—88—0770 (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23).) After a jury trial, defendant was again found guilty of the foregoing offense and was sentenced to a term of 364 days’ imprisonment with full credit for 364 days previously served. Defendant appeals from and we affirm his conviction.\\nAt defendant’s trial, Dwight police officer Tim Henson testified that on October 14, 1987, he saw defendant’s car parked in a handicapped zone. After observing that the car displayed no handicapped parking permit, Henson ran a license check which revealed that the car was registered to the defendant, whose driver’s license had been revoked in Illinois. Some time later, Henson observed the defendant enter his car and drive out of the parking lot. After Henson stopped the vehicle, defendant gave him a Kansas driver’s license. Henson’s check revealed that defendant did, in fact, have a Kansas driver’s license. However, Henson noticed several areas of misleading information on the Kansas license. He testified that defendant’s date of birth, eye color, and weight were different when he compared the information on the Kansas license with the information on the Illinois license. Henson issued defendant a citation for DWR.\\nFollowing Henson’s testimony, the State admitted into evidence People’s exhibit No. 1, which is a certification by the Illinois Secretary of State that defendant’s driving privileges were revoked on May 22, 1980, and that the revocation was in effect on October 14,1987.',\n",

The decision date is (1991-02-07)\\n\\nDefendant testified that he could not explain the discrepancies in the two licenses because, in order to receive his Kansas license, he had to turn in his Illinois license \"which they got the information off of.” On cross-examination, defendant was shown People’s exhibit No. 2, which is a Kansas driver’s license application bearing defendant’s signature dated September 25, 1985. Defendant admitted that his height and eye color were not the same on his Illinois license and his Kansas license application. The Kansas license application also contains a series of questions, the first of which reads, “Is your license suspended or revoked?” The response checked on the application is “No.”\\nOn appeal, defendant concedes that he was driving on the highways of this State -with a revoked Illinois license, but contends that he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree. When presented with a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, it is not the function of this court to retry the defendant. (People v. Collins (1985), 106 Ill. 2d 237, 261, 478 N.E.2d 267, 277.) Once the defendant has been found guilty of the charged crime, the fact finder’s role as weigher of the evidence is preserved through a legal conclusion that, upon judicial review, all the evidence is to be considered in the light most favorable to the prosecution. (Jackson v. Virginia (1979), 443 U.S. 307, 319, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560, 573, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 2789; Collins, 106 Ill. 2d at 261, 478 N.E.2d at 277.) The relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in such a fashion, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319, 61 L. Ed. 2d at 573, 99 S. Ct. at 2789; Collins, 106 Ill. 2d at 261, 478 N.E.2d at 277.',\n",

(People v. Turner (1976), 64 Ill. 2d 183, 185, 354 N.E.2d 897, 898; People v. Papproth (1977), 56 Ill. App. 3d 683, 686, 371 N.E.2d 1097, 1099.) The proper issuance of a foreign license under article VII of the Illinois Vehicle Code (Code) entitled “Driver License Compact” (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 951/2, pars. 6 — 700 through 6 — 708), terminates an Illinois revocation in the same way that issuance of an Illinois license under section 6 — 208 of the Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 951lz, par. 6— 208) terminates an Illinois revocation. (People v. Hutson (1989), 178 Ill. App. 3d 836, 838, 533 N.E.2d 1128, 1129, cert. denied (1989), 126 Ill. 2d 563.) However, if one purposely conceals the fact of the previous revocation of his license in order to mislead the authorities and prevent them from properly determining whether he should be granted a license, he may not interpose a license so procured as a defense to the charge of driving while his license was revoked. Turner, 64 Ill. 2d at 187, 354 N.E.2d at 899; Papproth, 56 Ill. App. 3d at 688, 371 N.E.2d at 1100.\\nIn Turner and Papproth, the defendants presented improperly obtained Blinois licenses as a defense to the charge of DWR. Although Turner and Papproth are distinguishable in this manner, this distinction provides no basis for reversing defendant’s conviction. There is no reason to find that a license fraudulently obtained in another State is a valid defense to a charge of driving on a revoked license in Illinois. This court’s decision in People v. Jordan (1980), 85 Ill. App. 3d 589, 406 N.E.2d 1135, lends support to our conclusion.',\n",

He contends that, like the defendant in Papproth, he obtained his license through an honest mistake rather than an act calculated to deceive. A misrepresentation in order to constitute a fraud must consist of a statement of material fact, false and known to be so by the party making it, made to induce the other party to act, and, in acting, the other party must rely on the truth of the statement. (Roth v. Roth (1970), 45 Ill. 2d 19, 23, 256 N.E.2d 838, 840.) The evidence supports a finding of fraud.\\nPeople’s exhibit No. 1 includes the certification of the Blinois Secretary of State that all statutory notices of revocation were properly given. The matter of defendant’s knowledge of the revocation was an issue for the trier of fact. The additional discrepancies between the Blinois and Kansas licenses provided the jury with further evidence from which to infer that defendant’s statement that his license was not revoked was not the product of an honest mistake or confusion. In sum, the jury could properly infer that the defendant knew his Blinois license was revoked, that he informed the Kansas Secretary of State that it was not revoked in order to induce the issuance of a license, and that the Kansas Secretary of State issued a driver’s license in reliance upon his misrepresentation.\\nAccordingly, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to prove the elements of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\\nAffirmed.\\nSPITZ and McCULLOUGH, JJ., concur.',\n",

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nMr. JUSTICE LONDRIGAN\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nOn June 18,1978, plaintiff, Delores Moore, attended a skeet-shooting competition at Chanute Air Force base in Rantoul, at which she used her Remington Model 1100 shotgun. After shooting approximately 25 shotgun shells, Moore loaded her gun with a blue Remington shell; upon firing at the next target, the gun exploded in her hands, causing severe injury to her left thumb and hand.\\nThis suit against Remington Arms Company, Inc. (Remington), the manufacturer of the gun and shotgun shell, and against Joe Lewis, d/b/a Lewis Reloader Supply (Lewis), the retail seller of the gun, followed. The suit was grounded in strict liability. The third amended complaint, upon which the case was tried, alleged (1) that the gun was defectively designed (against Remington in count I and against Lewis in count III); (2) that the gun was defectively manufactured out of defective metal (against Remington in count II and against Lewis in count IV); and (3) that the shotgun shell was defectively manufactured (count V against Remington). Plaintiff sought compensatory damages based on these allegations. In count VI of her complaint, plaintiff sought punitive damages from Remington based upon its knowledge of prior similar explosions and thus its prior knowledge of the defective nature of the shotgun. The jury returned verdicts in favor of plaintiff and against Remington, awarding plaintiff $161,288.79 in compensatory damages and $85,000 in punitive damages. The jury absolved Lewis of liability.\\nThe main thrust of this appeal by Remington attacks the punitive damages award and the trial court’s related evidentiary rulings. Remington also challenges the awarding of compensatory damages but not the amount awarded.',\n",

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nPlaintiff, her husband James Moore, and the referee were present when the gun exploded, and they testified at trial. All three are experienced marksmen and gun owners. James Moore purchased the Model 1100 Remington shotgun for plaintiff on June 17, 1977, from defendant Lewis. At that time the gun was new and appeared to James Moore to be a standard Model 1100. The gun was used only by the Moores and exclusively for skeet shooting between its purchase and the explosion. Mr. Moore regularly cleaned and maintained the gun; when he cleaned the gun earlier in the week of its explosion he noticed nothing irregular about it.\\nOn June 18, 1978, plaintiff shot 25 targets, or one series or round, using red reloaded Winchester shells. That particular competition involved shooting at two targets consecutively that were thrown from different “houses.” At the start of her second round plaintiff shot at the first target but the second target came out of the house broken. The rules of the game require that the referee give the marksman a replacement shell. Plaintiff and James Moore testified that the referee, Alan Barber, provided plaintiff with a blue Remington RXP shell. Barber could not remember the color of the shell he gave plaintiff but testified that the gun exploded when she fired it using the replacement shell. Barber was an arm’s length away from plaintiff when she fired the gun, and it exploded into pieces.',\n",

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nPlaintiff said that her husband was reloading only red-colored shells at that time and that on the date of the explosion she had shot only red-colored Winchester shells. Referee Barber stated that the shell that he gave plaintiff had been taken by him from the vault of the gun club sponsoring the competition. Barber was an official of the gun club and testified that the vault contained only factory-loaded shells and no “reloads.” He stated that the gun club was not allowed to sell or give out reloaded shells. Barber testified that at that time the gun club bought their shells from Lewis.\\nShotgun shells purchased from manufacturers are called factory-loaded shells and may be fired without alteration; these shells have new cases. After a shell is fired, the shell case may be “reloaded.” Much of the factual conflict in this case revolves around the nature of the shotgun shell in the gun when the accident occurred. Plaintiff’s contention, as evidenced by the foregoing facts, was that she used a factory-loaded blue Remington shotgun shell. Remington’s defense centered on the argument that the shell in the gun was an improperly reloaded shell and that the improper assembly of the shell by an unknown individual (either one of the Moores or the gun club), not the defective nature of the gun or shell, caused the explosion.\\nWith the exception of the type of shell used, the events of the incident itself were undisputed by Remington. The controversy over whether the shotgun shell was a factory load or a reloaded shell drew an opinion from almost every witness. The shell fragment, purportedly from the shell that was in the gun at the time of the explosion, was introduced into evidence as plaintiff’s exhibit No. 6. For comparison purposes, a factory-loaded shell was introduced as plaintiff’s exhibit No. 7. Remington introduced testimony that the shell in the gun when the gun exploded was a reload.\\nPlaintiffs Expert Witness',\n",

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nPlaintiffs Expert Witness\\nDr. David Levinson, plaintiff’s expert witness, is a professor of metallurgy in the department of metals engineering at the University of Illinois, Chicago Circle Campus, and has a Ph.D in metallurgical engineering. Levinson took samples from the gun metal for a metallographic analysis; he photographed samples of the gun metal with a scanning electron microscope and performed hardness tests on it.\\nAccording to Levinson, the Moore gun barrel was made of a “free-machining” steel also commonly referred to as “resulphurized” steel, which is similar to “AISI 1140” steel. A free-machining steel is one alloyed with substances such as manganese or sulphur or sometimes lead to make it easier to handle in the manufacturing process. These substances are referred to as inclusions and are found in the metal; in general, inclusions appear as very small cracks, not visible to the naked eye but visible under a scanning electron microscope. Inclusions are deliberately present in the steel and are common to free-machining or resulphurized steels. Levinson stated that inclusions frequently are sites for the inception of cracks and that cracks may grow away from an inclusion. Upon examining the Moore barrel, Levinson found both inclusions and cracks.\\nIn Levinson’s opinion, AISI 1140, the metal used in the Moore barrel, is a relatively inexpensive steel and desirable from the standpoint of the manufacturer because, as a free-machining steel, it finishes easily. Levinson stated that he did not think that it was a good material from which to make shotgun barrels, however, because of its susceptibility to the initiation and growth of cracks at the sites of elongated manganese sulfide inclusions.',\n",

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nAccording to Levinson it is possible for not only the inclusions but the cracks to be present prior to the gun’s leaving the hands of the manufacturer. Levinson stated that the cracks could result from proof testing which is done to the gun barrel by the manufacturer. A proof test is a test in which the barrel is subjected to a propellant charge that produces a pressure greater than normal. Levinson stated that the proof test performed by Remington on the guns will take one of three results: (1) A totally defective barrel with very large inclusions will break during proof testing; (2) a high quality gun barrel that is essentially free of inclusions or that has small and well distributed inclusions will be unaffected by the proof test; (3) an intermediate range of barrel that has elongated inclusions will not break during the proof testing, but the proof testing will make the gun more dangerous for subsequent use.\\nLevinson stated that the concentration of inclusions in free-machining steel varies among individual pieces cut. As a result, not all barrels made of 1140 free-machining steel will eventually explode; only guns that are\\nmade from a batch of steel with a higher than average concentration of inclusions or that have longer inclusions near the firing chamber are subject to that danger. Thus one barrel might be defective but the next one adequate.\\nIn discussing the explosion of a defective barrel, Levinson stated that the cracks in the barrel would grow over a period of time to the point where the next normal stress or factory load fired from the barrel would cause the barrel to explode.',\n",

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nLevinson compared the steel used in the Moore barrel with a steel called chrome molybdenum steel, also referred to as 4140. Levinson said that chrome molybdenum steel is almost free of inclusions and is not a free-machining steel. Levinson stated that he compared 4140 to the steel in the Moore gun because it is frequently cited as being an appropriate steel for firearms and is often used in their manufacture. Levinson testified that in his opinion resulphurized steel is a bad choice of metal for shotgun barrels and concluded that the Moore gun was unreasonably dangerous when it was manufactured and that the gun failed due to a metallurgical design mistake.\\nRemington Committee Members\\nRobert Balaska, a design engineer for Remington, testified that he examined the Moore gun as part of a committee at Remington that looks at guns sent to the company to determine why they have failed. Balaska stated that in the preceding three or four months he had examined six to eight guns that looked like the Moore gun. Balaska knew of other situations where guns had exploded and injured persons but stated that the explosions were not similar to the Moore explosion. The conclusion of the committee was that the cause of the Moore gun explosion was a high pressure load round or defective ammunition. Balaska admitted that the report did not specifically mention hand-reloaded shells to be the cause.',\n",

Stat. 1979, ch. 110, par. 60). Stekl was supervisor of product services of the firearms for Remington and handled customers’ complaints about firearms. Stekl testified that the committee reports stated that the gun damage was caused by defective ammunition. Stekl stated that if it were determined that the shell was a new Remington RXP shell, his opinion of the cause of the explosion would be the same. Plaintiff attempted to question Stekl regarding a list of prior explosions provided by Remington to plaintiff as answers to interrogatories. Stekl admitted having examined other Remington Model 1100 shotguns where persons had been injured but denied knowing of occurrences similar to the Moore explosion. Plaintiff’s attorney then read the interrogatory answer in which Remington admitted the existence of “similar occurrences” to the explosion in the instant case. During clarification, Stekl stated that prior to the Moore gun explosion he was unaware of any complaint of a gun failure due to inclusions in the metal. The Moore gun was made of the same metal that Remington has always used for Model 1100 shotguns.\\nStekl conceded that Remington, in answer to interrogatories, had admitted receiving complaints about Remington RXP shotgun shells but noted that four complaints in all had been received about the shells and none of them was in any way related to high pressure in the shells.\\nRemingtons Evidence\\nJoe Lewis, former owner of Lewis Reloader Supply, testified that according to his records, the last time he made a sale to the gun club at Chanute Air Force base was February 24, 1975.

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nPhillip P. Johnson, supervisor of chemical and metallurgical control at Remington, is responsible for purchasing steel for the company and for insuring the quality of raw materials purchased by it. Remington has been using AISI 1140 modified steel in its Model 1100 shotguns since 1960. There has been no change in the specifications for the steel during that time, and the same steel is used in all shotgun barrels that Remington produces. The term “modified” after the number indicates that there is slightly more manganese and sulphur added to the steel than would be present in the “standard” 1140; Remington pays a slight premium price for this. Johnson acknowledged that chrome molybdenum steel does not have as many inclusions in it as AISI 1140 modified, but he denied that the presence of the inclusions weakens the barrel. Johnson admitted that chrome molybdenum was probably a better steel for use in shotgun barrels than AISI 1140 modified.\\nJohnson examined the Moore gun for metallurgical defects. His conclusion was that the cause of the explosion was a high pressure chamber burst, caused by pressure greater than that that would be produced by firing a normal factory-loaded shotgun shell. The committee at Remington believed that the cause of the explosion was most likely a hand-loaded shell.\\nJohnson had not seen the shotgun shell, plaintiff’s exhibit No. 6, prior to trial. After examining the shell at trial, it was his opinion that it was a reloaded one. Further, assuming that that shell was ii) the gun at the time of the explosion, it was Johnson’s opinion that the cause of the gun failure was extreme high pressure caused by the reloaded shell.',\n",

Johnson asserted that inclusions cannot cause the type of defects that result in explosions.\\nKenneth Packer, a Ph.D in industrial engineering, is a consulting engineer and the founder of Packer Engineering Associates. The Moore gun was brought by Remington to Packer to determine the cause of the failure. When the test gun was substantially overloaded with too much gunpowder it blew up. Although Packer stated that after firing, the overloaded gun appeared identical to the Moore gun, he admitted on cross-examination that the test gun, which was introduced into evidence, exhibited less damage than the Moore gun. Nevertheless, Packer was convinced by the test he performed that the cause of the explosion of the Moore gun was a high pressure handload or reload. His opinion was based in part on the condition of the shell that he had been given. Both the damage to the crimp and the markings on the brass portion of the head of the shell were noted by Packer in support of his theory that the shell had been hand-loaded.',\n",

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nIn discussing free-machining versus non-free-machining steel, Packer noted that free-machining steel allows for precise manufacturing, which is a safety feature. Free-machining steel also increases in strength with higher temperatures and is, in fact, a stronger steel in the range of temperatures which are created when a gun is fired. Packer examined shotguns made of both free-machining and non-free-machining steel, and it was his opinion that it was not an unreasonably dangerous practice to use 1140 modified in the manufacture of shotguns but to the contrary was an excellent practice. Packer denied that the inclusions make the barrel weaker and stated that for a factory-loaded round to cause a gun to burst, a crack or defect in the gun would have to go one-half to three-quarters of the way through the barrel.\\nSpencer Wildman, the chief process supervisor at one of Remington’s plants, supervises engineers in control of the process of manufacturing ammunition. He had not seen plaintiff’s exhibit No. 6 prior to trial but after examining the shell stated, to a reasonable degree of engineering certainty, that it was a reloaded shell. Wildman concluded that the damage to the shell was probably the result of an excessive high-pressure reload.\\nWildman described the process at the Remington factory for loading Remington shells. There are several devices in the manufacturing process that insure that the correct amount of gunpowder is included in each shell. It is impossible for only one shell in a batch to contain twice the correct amount of powder. However, if the machine involved was maladjusted, a series of shells could be produced with a greater than normal load of powder.\\nWildman has received consumer complaints with regard to Remington shells but has never received a complaint that a new Remington shell had too much gunpowder. Wildman knew of no one at Remington who had ever received such a complaint.\\nRemington Employee as an Adverse Witness',\n",

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nRemington Employee as an Adverse Witness\\nRemington initially complains that its employee, James Stekl, was improperly required to testify as an adverse witness under section 60 of the Civil Practice Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 110, par. 60). Stekl was impeached by Remington’s answers to plaintiff’s written interrogatories in which Remington admitted that other Model 1100 shotguns had exploded in “similar occurrences” to that of the Moore gun. Had Stekl not been called under section 60, he could not have been impeached with Remington’s answers to those interrogatories, as a party cannot impeach his own witness. (Martin v. Rrennan (1977), 54 Ill. App. 3d 421, 425, 369 N.E.2d 601, 605.) Remington asserts that the interrogatory answers would not have been allowed into evidence but for Stekl’s testimony. Remington’s contention is that Stekl is not within one of the categories of witnesses eligible to be called under section 60. Section 60 provides in part:\\n“Examination of adverse party or agent. Upon the trial of any case any party thereto or any person for whose immediate benefit the action is prosecuted or defended, or the officers, directors, managing agents or foreman of any party to the action, may be called and examined as if under cross-examination at the instance of any adverse party.” (Emphasis added.) Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 110, par. 60.\\nStekl was Remington’s corporate representative at trial; he signed the written interrogatory answers on Remington’s behalf. Stekl testified that his job was “supervisor of product services, firearms,” and explained that it basically involved handling customers’ complaints about firearms. Stekl asserted that he was not an officer, director, foreman, or managing officer of Remington and further stated that he supervised no employees. Stekl was a member of the committee that examines guns that fail.',\n",

Stat. 1979, ch. 110A, par. 213(c).) Stekl was essentially the head of a one-person department. His job responsibility and his presence as Remington’s representative at trial support the trial court’s determination that Stekl was a managing agent of Remington and thus properly called under section 60.\\nInterrogatory Answers as an Admission of Knowledge\\nPlaintiff’s claim for punitive damages rests largely on the interrogatory answers tendered to her by Remington, specifically those to questions 12 and 13. Interrogatory No. 12 asks:\\n“Was any Model 1100 Shotgun of the type or model involved in the occurrence in question as described in the Complaint, involved in any similar occurrences as the one here at any time prior or subsequent to June 18,1978.”\\nRemington’s answer was “Yes.” Interrogatory No. 13 required specifics. It stated:\\n“If the answer to the foregoing Interrogatory is the affirmative, state:\\na. The date or dates of such occurrences;\\nb. The name and last known address of the person or persons suffering personal injury or property damage as a result thereof;\\nc. The cause of each said occurrence;\\nd.

The person or persons having custody of the records, reports, or files of the occurrence or occurrences given in the answers to this Interrogatory.”\\nRemington responded to interrogatory No. 13 with a list of 67 persons, their addresses, the date of the occurrence, and the “cause” thereof.',\n",

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nRemington responded to interrogatory No. 13 with a list of 67 persons, their addresses, the date of the occurrence, and the “cause” thereof.\\nAt trial, in examining James Stekl as an adverse witness, plaintiff asked him a series of questions regarding these interrogatories over continued objections by Remington. Upon being read interrogatory No. 12 Stekl said that he did not believe that there were any occurrences or explosions similar to that of the Moore gun before or after June 18,1978. Plaintiff’s counsel then read both the question and the answer to interrogatory No. 12. Eventually, Stekl admitted that he had signed the interrogatories in Remington’s behalf and that the interrogatory in fact admitted the existence of similar occurrences. The only information received by the jury with regard to interrogatory No. 13, however, was that Remington’s answer listed 67 persons; the causes of these “similar occurrences” were not explained at trial.\\nThe main problem is not whether the answer to interrogatory No. 12 could be used to impeach Stekl; in light of Stekl’s answers to plaintiff’s counsel’s questions, the interrogatory and answer constituted a prior inconsistent statement and were properly admitted as such. The problem in this case is whether the question and answer to interrogatory No. 12 constituted substantive evidence that Remington had knowledge of a defect in its guns prior to the explosion in this case.\\nPrior similar occurrences are admissible for the purpose of establishing knowledge on the part of a manufacturer that a defect in the product existed prior to the injuries in the litigated case. Proof of such knowledge served as part of the basis for the award of punitive damages in Moore v. Jewel Tea Co. (1969), 116 Ill.

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nIn Moore a can of Drano, a caustic drain cleaner, which had never been opened, exploded in the plaintiffs hands, causing her severe injury. In discussing the admission of prior similar occurrences, the appellate court stated:\\n“The record reveals that the trial court limited evidence of prior accidents to explosion claims against defendants where there was no opening of the can or any extraneous matter added or anything done to it. The court not only rejected cases where water or some outside material was added to the can, it refused plaintiffs’ request to allow evidence of prior spontaneous explosions which occurred after the Drano had been subjected to its normal use. Under these guidelines the plaintiffs introduced evidence of three prior accidents in which a Drano can which had not been opened exploded and after which a claim was made against Drackett.” 116 Ill. App. 2d 109, 129, 253 N.E.2d 636, 645.\\nThe trial court in Moore limited admissible instances of prior similar occurrences to those that clearly would have put the manufacturer on notice that a defect in the product existed.\\nSubsequently, in Rucker v. Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. (1979), 77 Ill. 2d 434, 440-41, 396 N.E.2d 534, 537-38, the supreme court expanded upon the requirements for the admissibility of prior similar occurrences in strict liability cases. In Rucker the plaintiff sought to introduce evidence of prior occurrences to establish the existence of a dangerous defect. (In Rucker there was no request for punitive damages.) The supreme court stated that in determining the admissibility of prior occurrences to establish the dangerousness of an item “[i]t need not be shown that the accidents occurred in an identical manner. Substantial similarity is all that is required.” 77 Ill. 2d 434, 441, 396 N.E.2d 534, 538.',\n",

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nWe find that interrogatory No. 12 was too generalized and vague to fulfill the “substantial similarity” requirement enunciated by the court in Rucker. The question placed no time limit on “similar occurrences,” and thus Remington’s answer could have included only incidents that occurred after the explosion in this case. Clearly, only prior occurrences are relevant to establishing plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages. Further, the interrogatory makes no attempt to describe what the term “similar” means, and, as is made clear by Remington’s answer, Remington did not interpret this question as limiting similar occurrences to those that had similar causes. We note that Remington’s answer to interrogatory No. 13, not in evidence, listed “high pressure reload” as the cause of 58 of the 67 occurrences and that all 67 occurred before June 1978.',\n",

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nThe purpose of the admission of prior occurrences to establish punitive damages in products liability cases is to show that the manufacturer had or should have had knowledge of harm inflicted on consumers by its product and with flagrant indifference to public safety failed to warn consumers of or remedy the defect. There is nothing inherent in the answer given by Remington to interrogatory No. 12 that establishes that Remington had been put on notice of a defect and acted in disregard thereof. Guns are inherently dangerous instrumentalities. The mere fact that other guns had exploded does not, therefore, in and of itself support the existence of a defect. The information presented at trial from the interrogatories did not constitute an admission sufficient to establish knowledge of a defect in the gun metal. Plaintiff was certainly not bound by Remington’s decisions regarding the causes of the prior explosions and could have tried to prove that one or more of the prior gun failures was caused by a defect in the gun metal or manufacturing. The failure to show that any of the causes listed by Remington were at odds with what actually occurred, or with what the person involved in the explosion believed occurred, further demonstrates plaintiff’s inability to establish that Remington should have been put on notice of a defect in its guns by these prior explosions.\\nStandard for Awarding Punitive Damages in Products Cases',\n",

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nStandard for Awarding Punitive Damages in Products Cases\\nDefendant asserts that the trial court erred in denying its successive motions for a directed verdict, judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and a new trial on count VI, plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages. We have viewed the evidence in its aspect most favorable to plaintiff and agree that the trial court should have granted the motion for a directed verdict. (Pedrick v. Peoria & Eastern R.R. Co. (1967), 37 Ill. 2d 494, 229 N.E.2d 504.) This question requires us to discuss the evidence necessary to survive a motion for a directed verdict or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of punitive damages in a products liability case. The facts presented by Moore v. Jewel Tea Co. (1969), 116 Ill. App. 2d 109, 253 N.E.2d 636, affd (1970), 46 Ill. 2d 288, 263 N.E.2d 103, have become the standard by which claims for punitive damages are measured in Illinois. (Johnson v. Amerco, Inc. (1980), 87 Ill. App. 3d 827, 409 N.E.2d 299.) The appellate court’s decision in Moore, however, was based on an especially sympathetic set of facts: (1) the corporation’s knowledge of the danger inherent in the product, (2) the failure to warn the public of that danger, and (3) notice to the corporation of prior claims of spontaneously exploding cans of Drano. Although Moore may represent a classic case in which an award of punitive damages is proper, it would not be appropriate to require the facts in other cases to be as egregious as those presented by Moore to pose a jury question on the issue of punitive damages. The Illinois Supreme Court has not yet spoken on the proper standard to guide courts in awarding punitive damages in products liability cases; in its opinion in Moore the supreme court affirmed the appellate decision without addressing this issue. Several problems in applying the general test to claims for punitive damages in products cases show why a special standard is needed in this area of the law.',\n",

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nThe general purposes of punitive damages are to punish wrongdoers and to deter them and others from engaging in similar conduct. (Kelsay v. Motorola, Inc. (1978), 74 Ill. 2d 172, 186, 384 N.E.2d 353, 359.) The goals are the same in the context of products liability, but the unique concern here is deterring manufacturers from placing dangerously defective products into the stream of commerce by making this unprofitable to an unpredictable degree. See generally D. Owen, Punitive Damages in Products Liability Litigation, 74 Mich. L. Rev. 1257 (1976); Wangen v. Ford Motor Co. (1980), 97 Wis. 2d 260, 294 N.W.2d 437; Sturm, Ruger & Co. v. Day (Alas. 1979), 594 P.2d 38, opinion on rehearing (1980), 615 P.2d 621, opinion on rehearing (1981), 627 P.2d 204.\\nKelsay expressed the general, traditional standard for awarding punitive damages:\\n“It has long been established in this State that punitive or exemplary damages may be awarded when torts are committed with fraud, actual malice, deliberate violence or oppression, or when the defendant acts willfully, or with such gross negligence as to indicate a wanton disregard of the rights of others [citation].” (74 Ill. 2d 172, 186, 384 N.E.2d 353, 359.)\\nThe concept of awarding punitive damages in products cases is not without difficulty. Defendants in this area of litigation are generally manufacturers and frequently, as is the case here, large national concerns that command little sympathy from jurors. Plaintiffs in these cases, on the other hand, often have been injured severely, normally while exercising due care for their own safety. Furthermore, punitive damages are subject to abuse because they have little or no relation to the actual damages suffered by a plaintiff. See D. Owen, Problems in Assessing Punitive Damages Against Manufacturers of Defective Products (Draft to appear at 49 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1 (1982)).',\n",

The decision date is (1981-10-15)\\n\\nIllinois was in the vanguard in permitting punitive damages in Moore; at that time few courts had been presented with the question of punitive damages in products cases and only a handful had allowed them. (Toole v. Richardson-Merrell, Inc. (1967), 251 Cal. App. 2d 689, 60 Cal. Rptr. 398; Roginsky v. Richardson-Merrell, Inc. (2d Cir. 1967), 378 F.2d 832; D. Owen, Punitive Damages in Products Liability Litigation, 74 Mich. L. Rev. 1257, 1261 n.12 (1976).) The tide has since turned: judgments for punitive damages are now routinely entered across the nation, and staggering sums have been awarded. (Leichtamer v. American Motors Corp. (1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 456, 424 N.E.2d 568 ($1 million to one plaintiff and $100,000 to another); Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co. (1981), 119 Cal. App. 3d 757, 174 Cal. Rptr. 348 ($3.5 million); Gryc v. Dayton-Hudson Corp. (Minn. 1980), 297 N.W.2d 727 ($1 million).) We cannot dismiss lightly either the general trend or the result of the trial court in this case. The supreme court recently spoke to the need for tight judicial control over awards of punitive damages:\\n“Because of their penal nature, punitive damages are not favored in the law, and the courts must take caution to see that punitive damages are not improperly or unwisely awarded.” (Kelsay, 74 Ill. 2d 172, 188, 384 N.E.2d 353, 360.)\\nIn the area of products liability the susceptibility to abuse, noted above, makes such control even more necessary. The Alaska Supreme Court, noting Professor Owen’s suggestion that awards of punitive damages in products liability cases be scrutinized closely by the courts (D. Owen, Punitive Damages in Products Liability Litigation, 74 Mich. L. Rev. 1257, 1321 (1976)), explained:',\n",

The spectre of bankruptcy and excessive punishment can be in part dispelled to the extent that trial and appellate courts exercise their powers of review.” Sturm, Roger & Co., 594 P.2d 38, 48.\\nGreater judicial control will be gained by clarifying the terms used in the general standard for punitive damages. Ascribing the human qualities of malice and wilfulness to corporate entities is often paradoxical; from his study of products cases Owen has isolated “the two predominant characteristics” of commercial misconduct that make appropriate an award of punitive damages: From these characteristics Owen derives the following standard to guide courts in awarding punitive damages in products cases:\\n“The first is the manufacturer’s lack of concern for the public safety, a spirit of utter indifference to whether the product might cause unnecessary injuries. The second characteristic is the flagrancy of this indifference as reflected by the extent of the manufacturer’s awareness of the danger and its excessiveness, the over-all magnitude of the danger to the public, the ease of reducing the risk, and the motives and other circumstances attending the manufacturer’s failure to reduce the risk.” (D. Owen, Punitive Damages in Products Liability Litigation, 74 Mich. L. Rev. 1257, 1366 (1976).)\\n“Punitive damages may be assessed against the manufacturer of a product injuring the plaintiff if the injury is attributable to conduct that reflects a flagrant indifference to the public safety.” (D. Owen, Punitive Damages in Products Liability Litigation, 74 Mich. L. Rev. 1257, 1367 (1976).)',\n",

The facts stated are not sufficient to bring the property within the description of a “public school house.” (Montgomery v. Wyman, 130 Ill. 17; McCullough v. Board of Review, 183 id. 373.) Nor does it appear the said real estate is the property of an institution of learning. The legal title is in John L. Spaulding, as catholic bishop of Peoria, according to the finding' of the board of review. If the statements of the petition as to the state of the title be accepted, the title rests in the said Spaulding as catholic bishop of Peoria, for the use, not of the said St. Columba’s school, but of the congregation of St. Columba’s parish of said church. It is essential to the exemption of property as being the property of an institution of learning, the title to the property shall be in the institution of learning or in some society or congregation holding, and authorized by law to hold, the title for the institution of learning, or in some person or corporation in trust for the said institution of learning.

The decision date is (1954-05-24)\\n\\nMr. Justice Hershey\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nAppellees, hereinafter called plaintiffs, filed a complaint in the circuit court of Edwards County seeking a determination and declaration of the rights, title and interest of the parties hereto, under an oil-and-gas lease, an assignment of the lease, and a reservation of an overriding royalty interest in the assignment. The chief controversy between the parties is the extent of the overriding royalty interest reserved by R. I. Ery, one of the plaintiffs, under the terms of the assignment. The complaint alleges and the plaintiffs contend that said assignment reserved to the plaintiff Fry an overriding royalty interest in %4ths of the %ths working interest under the lease. The defendants contend that the said assignment reserved to Fry only %ths of %4ths of the %ths of the working interest under the lease. The %ths working interest referred to is that portion of the oil and gas produced from the premises after the royalty for the share paid the lessor under the lease is deducted. The working interest has been held by this court to be a freehold interest. (Illinois National Oil and Gas Co. v. Sinclair, 373 Ill. 581; Triger v. Carter Oil Co. 372 Ill. 182.) It is clear, therefore, that a freehold is involved in the proceeding here and that this court has jurisdiction by direct appeal. On hearing, the chancellor ■found the interest of the plaintiff Fry to be as set forth in the complaint and granted the relief prayed.\\nThe facts are not in dispute. The inferences to be drawn from the facts, however, are the basis of contention between the parties.. R. W. Curtis owned real estate in Edwards County, Illinois. Sometime prior to May 20, 1950, he conveyed an undivided one-fourth interest in the oil and gas and other minerals under said premises to certain grantees not concerned with this proceeding.',\n",

Fry acquired an oil-and-gas lease covering and including all of said real estate from Curtis and his wife. The usual lessor royalty was reserved and the lease contained a “lesser interest clause” which-reads as follows: “If said lessor owns a less interest in the above described land than the entire and undivided fee simple estate therein, then the royalties herein provided for shall be paid to said lessor only in the proportion which lessors’ interest bears to the whole and undivided fee.”\\nOn October 7, 1950, Fry assigned said oil-and-gas lease to Jack Hinkle doing business as Jack Hinkle Drilling Company. The assignee was represented in the negotiations for the assignment by one D. G. Lieberknecht as agent. The record indicated that both Fry and Lieberknecht are familiar with the oil-and-gas business, each having been engaged therein for many years.\\nThe assignment was made using a printed form. Two clauses were inserted in the printed form — one dealing with a reservation of royalty interest to Fry which read as follows: “The assignor hereby reserves unto himself a Three-sixty-fourths (%4ths) over-riding royalty out of the Seven-eights (%ths) working interest.”\\nThe other clause inserted in the printed form of assignment dealt with the warranties of the assignor and read as follows: “It is distinctly understood that assignor does not warrant this Title.”\\nThe evidence indicates that the assignment was prepared and the clauses inserted by Lieberknecht, agent for the assignee.\\nSubsequently Fry assigned Vmth of his reserved %4ths overriding royalty of the %ths working interest to Cecil and Mary Webb, husband and wife, also plaintiff-appellees in this proceeding.',\n",

The decision date is (1954-05-24)\\n\\nSubsequently Fry assigned Vmth of his reserved %4ths overriding royalty of the %ths working interest to Cecil and Mary Webb, husband and wife, also plaintiff-appellees in this proceeding.\\nOn November 10, 1950, an oil-and-gas well on the real estate involved in this proceeding was brought in as a producer. The oil was sold to the Farm Bureau Oil Company, a pipe-line purchaser. A division order prepared by the purchaser was presented to Fry and Webb for signature by Lieberknecht who was still, apparently, an agent for the assignee. The division order declared the interest of Fry to be %4ths of the %ths working interest as a free and overriding royalty and that of the Webbs, Cecil and' Mary jointly, to be of the %ths working interest also as a free and overriding royalty. Because Cecil Webb desired his interest to be payable only to himself and not jointly with his wife, a second division order was requested notwithstanding the fact that all parties had signed the original division order.\\nThe second division order was prepared and was represented by Lieberknecht to be identical with the first except that the Webbs’ check would be payable only to Cecil Webb. The interests of Fry and the Webbs in the second division order, in fact, were reduced by one fourth. Their total interest was represented as %ths of %4ths of the %ths working interest as a free and overriding royalty. This reduction of their interest was discovered on the receipt of the first check from the Farm Bureau Oil Company.\\nWhen Fry obtained the oil-and-gas lease from Curtis he acquired a lease that did not include an undivided %th interest in the oil and gas and other minerals. The lessor had, by a mineral conveyance, previously divested himself of this fractional portion of the mineral estate. The lesser interest clause would therefore operate to reduce the lessor’s royalty to an amount commensurate with his ownership. Here the reduction of the lessor’s interest amounts to one fourth.\",\n",

The decision date is (1954-05-24)\\n\\nThe lesser interest clause, while it operates to reduce the royalty of the lessor if he owns less than all the minerals, has no application as between the lessee and his assignee. (Walter v. Sohio Petroleum Co. 402 Ill. 33.) The lesser interest clause is in the lease — not in the assignment, and its application is concerned with a lease by a person who owns less than the entire fee. As to the assignment, however, the consideration is recited in the assignment — in this case a %4ths overriding royalty out of the %ths working interest.\\nThe evidence is clear, as the court below found, that Lieberknecht, as agent for the assignee, knew that the lessor had, prior to the making of the lease, conveyed Véth of the mineral estate to other parties. Fry testified that at the time of the preparation of the assignment to the defendant Hinkle he advised Lieberknecht of the outstanding %th mineral interest. The testimony of Lieberknecht discloses that he at first denied this, but later in the testimony there was a discussion as to who \"owned the outstanding interest between Fry and himself. He knew therefrom that the lease, if assigned, could not cover this fractional interest. Notwithstanding this, the reservation of the overriding royalty contained in the assignment was measured by a fractional portion of the working interest. Inasmuch as we have held herein that the lesser interest clause referred to herein by the appellant has no application as between the lessee and his assignee, the assignor here, namely plaintiff Fry, after said assignment was entitled to receive %4ths of %th working interest of the lessee, as the language of the assignment clearly states.',\n",

But when he arrived the State had already excused the police officer and the jury. Respondent said he appeared at Branch 34 first because of the common procedure in traffic court for the prosecutors and defense counsel to confer prior to a jury trial, and he did not anticipate that the State would be ready for trial the first time the case appeared on the jury call. Respondent further asserted that he had a “deep and abiding respect” for the presiding judge and “never meant to obstruct, prevent or embarrass the due administration of justice.”\\nOn the hearing date for the contempt petition, no evidence was presented, nor did respondent request a hearing. At the hearing, the assistant State’s Attorney reviewed the record and the attorney for the defendant referred to the facts set forth in his affidavit and answer.

Illinois courts have consistently characterized the unexplained absence of an attorney at trial as constituting possible grounds for indirect contempt which is not subject to being punished summarily. (People v. Edwards (1979), 69 Ill. App. 3d 626, 387 N.E.2d 969; People v. McNeil (1976), 42 Ill. App. 3d 1036, 356 N.E.2d 1073; People v. Pincham (1976), 38 Ill. App. 3d 1043, 350 N.E.2d 67.) It is to be noted there is a diversity of opinion in various other State courts as to whether such conduct constitutes a “direct” or “indirect” contempt. (See In re Potter (1981), 207 Neb. 769, 301 N.W.2d 560; Chula v. Superior Court (1962), 57 Cal. 2d 199, 368 P.2d 107, 18 Cal. Rptr. 507.)

In this case, respondent was aware of his scheduling conflict in advance of the trial date, yet he failed to take any steps to advise the court or the assistant State’s Attorney of his conflict. The result was inconvenience to the trial court, his client the defendant, the assistant State’s Attorney, the State’s witness, the prospective jurors, each of whom were present and ready for trial but unable to proceed. The trial court found respondent’s excuse for his tardiness unreasonable. The finding of guilty of contempt is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court, and' its decision will not be disturbed unless it is against the manifest weight of the evidence or the record disclosed an abuse of discretion. (In re Estate of St. George (1981), 99 Ill. App. 3d 388, 390, 426 N.E.2d 6.)

The prosecutor insisted that the pleas be to the indictment. The court then told defendants that if they were not willing to rely upon him they could submit the case to a jury. The prosecutor remarked that on a plea of guilty the court had two alternatives — either to give defendants the maximum sentence, or probation; that there could be no intermediate sentence given on a plea of guilty of robbery with a gun; that “larceny carries with it the penalty of one to ten years, but if we were to go ahead before a jury on this I would nolle prosse that count.” Just what “count” the prosecutor had in mind is uncertain. The following colloquy then took place in open court:\\nThe court: “If you are willing to submit the case to the court we feel it is expediting matters and feel that the defendants are trying to save time, as far as the court is concerned, and it should be encouraged. In other words, the defendants plead guilty and there is a certainty of some punishment and there is a speedy trial. All of those points are to be considered.\\nMr. West, assistant State’s attorney: “And the parole board would also consider those points when a man is sent down on a plea of guilty.\\nThe court: “Yes. All the penal institutions are overcrowded now, and unless they enlarge these ‘hotels’ the conditions will be getting worse. They take all those things into consideration.\\nMr. West: “Well, shall we proceed, counsel?',\n",

The statute contemplates that the plea of guilty can only be entered after a defendant has been fully advised by the court of his rights and the consequences of his plea. (Krolage v. People, 224 Ill. 456.) Here the record shows there was uncertainty and confusion whether the defendants were to be sentenced for larceny or for robbery with a gun. The court and State’s attorney both encouraged the defendants to plead guilty as a means of securing a lesser punishment. The trial judge indicated that he had a right under the pleas of guilty to sentence defendants either from one year to life on the charge of robbery with a gun or from one to ten years or could place them on probation, and said that he “would be inclined to take the second view of the case — that is, from one year to ten years. I am telling you this before you enter your pleas.” Thus the defendants entered their pleas of guilty believing that by reason of the court’s statement they would riot be sentenced for robbery but would receive a sentence of from one to ten years or be placed on probation.',\n",

The decision date is (1994-02-01)\\n\\nJUSTICE SC AMANO\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nOn March 15, 1993, respondent Julie Hull, an assistant Cook County public defender, was representing a juvenile at a probable cause hearing which was being held before Judge Arthur Rosenblum in Cook County circuit court. The juvenile, alleged to be delinquent, was charged with possession of a controlled substance, heroin, with intent to deliver. At the hearing, the State established through the arresting officer that while the juvenile was being pursued by the police, the officer saw him drop a cellophane bag. The officer later retrieved the bag and learned that it contained 120 foil-wrapped packets which, combined, proved to hold 36.5 grams of heroin.\\nDuring Hull’s cross-examination of the arresting officer she attempted to show that he was mistaken in his belief that it was her client who had dropped the heroin. For example, she sought to have him admit that he was well behind the juvenile while chasing him. She emphasized that it was dark when the officer pursued the youth and that the street where he allegedly dropped the bag was litter-strewn, thus intimating that the heroin was discarded by someone other than her client. The court sustained some of the State’s objections to this line of questioning and overruled others.\\nThe State next objected when Hull asked the officer to describe the size of the cellophane bag, and after the court sustained the objection, the following exchange took place:\\n\"Ms. Hull: May I have the basis your Honor? I am really — this is not a game. We don’t know if, in fact — he says he was behind him. He didn’t capture my client. It’s dark out and the — .\\nTHE COURT: Please. We don’t have a jury here.\\nMs. Hull: It’s not for the jury.\\nTHE COURT: I think it is.\\nMs. Hull: It’s called the right to confront, you know, the sixth amendment right.\\nTHE COURT: Oh, the sixth amendment of the constitution itself?\\nMs. Hull: Yeah, that’s why we have these hearings.',\n",

The court reminded her on more than one occasion that the State had previously and meritoriously objected to exactly the same questions and it further advised her that the answers to her questions were the proper subject matter of discovery requests but were inappropriate for the purposes of a hearing limited to determining whether the officer had sufficient cause to arrest the juvenile offender.\\nAt another point, she again demanded to know the basis of the court’s sustaining the State’s objection to a question she posed, and the court responded:\\n\"The basis of it is your demeanor, your line of questioning. I don’t know who you are trying to impress, but it’s not me that you are impressing, and we have gone over this several times but you go ahead.

At the close of cross-examination, the judge entered a finding that there existed probable cause to arrest and also found, based on the juvenile’s past record, that there were grounds to keep him in detention pending his delinquency adjudication.\\nHull then asserted a demand for trial on behalf of her client and the court scheduled the case to be heard two weeks later. Not satisfied with this date, she again demanded a trial, apparently indicating that her client sought a trial later that same day. \"When asked, the State informed the court that it would not be ready to present its case that soon on such scant notice, adding that the juvenile had not yet filed an answer to the delinquency petition nor had he submitted to the State’s discovery; therefore, it urged, he was not entitled to a hearing that day. The court then suggested that the two sides go to trial without the juvenile’s answer being filed or discovery having been completed, but the State stood on formality and repeated that it was not prepared for trial.\\nHull stated for the record that she was making her demand in order to begin the running of the 120-day period in compliance with the \"speedy trial” provision of the Juvenile Court Act. (705 ILCS 405/5 — 14 (West 1992) (formerly Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 37, par. 805 — 14).)

I find your demeanor, your courtroom demeanor, offensive and deliberately calculated to incur the anger of the Court and the patience of the Court. You are barred from coming into this court anymore.”\\nImmediately thereafter, Hull apparently turned, and as a last act of defiance, ran to the back of the court, put on her coat and headed out the door. The judge ordered her to return to the well of the court, remove her coat and appear before it dressed properly. It then dismissed her. In the written order handed down by the court, the order from which she appeals, Hull was barred from appearing before Judge Rosenblum in the future \"for all matters except those contested matters which were commenced prior to March 15, 1993[,] that she is the appointed attorney of record.”\\nHull’s principal contention on appeal is that section 6 of \"An Act to revise the law in relation to attorneys and counselors” (Act)\\n1\\n(705 ILCS 205/6 (West 1992) (formerly Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 13, par. 6)), which Act empowers circuit court judges to suspend attorneys appearing before them for malconduct, constitutes an impermissible legislative encroachment on an exclusive prerogative of the supreme court, namely, the regulation of the legal profession. According to Hull, the Act is an archaic vestige of an older era when poor communications necessitated authorizing circuit court judges to suspend dishonest attorneys in order to protect the public from them until such time when the supreme court could conduct proper disciplinary proceedings. She argues that with the creation of the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission (ARDC), this interim disciplinary authority can no longer reside in the circuit judges, but is reserved to the ARDC, endowed, as it is, with adequate investigative and adjudicatory capabilities.',\n",

The State suggests that in order to suspend her, the judge simply exercised his inherent authority to control his courtroom and to ensure that attorneys appearing before him exhibit proper respect for the authority of the court. The State also urges this court to find that Hull lacks standing to contest the constitutionality of the Act because the circuit judge did not expressly indicate that he was relying on the Act as the source of his authority to suspend her. Thus, according to the State, she cannot allege that she is aggrieved by the unconstitutional enactment. See People v. Rogers (1989), 133 Ill. 2d 1, 549 N.E.2d 266; People v.

The decision date is (1994-02-01)\\n\\nBoth of the State’s preliminary arguments are baseless. First, the trial court’s inherent power to control its courtroom and maintain the proper decorum extends no further than its ability to find someone in contempt (see In re G.B. (1981), 88 Ill. 2d 36, 430 N.E.2d 1096; In re F.B. (1990), 206 Ill. App. 3d 140, 564 N.E.2d 173); however, there exists no authority for the proposition that the trial court may invoke its power to declare an attorney in contempt and, as a consequence thereof, disbar or suspend him or her from appearing before it. As the United States Supreme Court has noted: \" \\'The power to disbar an attorney proceeds upon very different grounds’ from those which support a court’s power to punish for contempt.” Cammer v. United States (1956), 350 U.S. 399, 408 n.7, 100 L. Ed. 474, 479 n.7, 76 S. Ct. 456, 460 n.7, quoting Ex Parte Robinson (1873), 86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 505, 512, 22 L. Ed. 205, 208.\\nThe unfounded nature of the State’s position is also evident in those cases where our supreme court long ago addressed the extent of the authority conferred on a circuit court by the original version of the Act. In each case, the unexpressed yet underlying principle was that the ability to suspend an attorney resides innately in no court but the supreme court. Consequently, the circuit court’s authority to suspend Hull was fully dependent upon and was no broader than that which was expressly granted to it by the Act.',\n",

People (1869), 50 Ill. 449, the presiding judge of the St. Clair circuit court which, at that time, encompassed St. Clair and two other unnamed counties, permanently suspended an attorney from practicing in the courts of the entire circuit; the attorney had altered a court document so as to make an injunction extend to individuals who had not been before the court. On review, the supreme court vacated the suspension order as being overly broad, holding that the Act then in existence did not confer such broad authority on the circuit courts as to empower them to disbar de facto an attorney who was guilty of some misconduct. More important for the purpose of this case, it held: \"We know of no power inherent in the circuit courts, to suspend from practice an attorney duly licensed by this court; at least none, so to suspend him, as, virtually, to strike him from the roll.” Winkleman, 50 Ill. at 452.\\nLater in Moutray v. People ex rel. Morris (1896), 162 Ill. 194, 44 N.E. 496, the court held invalid an order of a circuit judge who prohibited two attorneys from appearing before any court in the Second Judicial District on a charge of forging court documents, effectively disbarring them in the courts of 14 counties. The supreme court held that the fullest extent of the Act was to enable the court to limit the practice of attorneys only in the court over which the suspending judge presides.',\n",

In that case, Wayland v. City of Chicago (1938), 369 Ill. 43, 15 N.E.2d 516, the court struck a local rule of the circuit court of Cook County which had created an executive commission of the court and charged it with the responsibility of suspending from practice in the circuit those attorneys who were deserving of such punishment. The court struck this rule on a variety of grounds, among which was that the Act, which the executive committee cited as the source of its authority, allowed a circuit judge to restrain the practice of attorneys only in the courtroom wherein he sat and nowhere else.',\n",

(In re Heirich (1957), 10 Ill. 2d 357, 362-63, 140 N.E.2d 825, 829; People ex rel. Andrews v. Hassakis (1955), 6 Ill. 2d 463, 468,129 N.E.2d 9,11, citing Ill. Rev. Stat. 1953, ch. 13, par. 6.) Accordingly, the State is clearly incorrect when it asserts that Judge Rosenblum derived his ability to suspend Hull from his inherent power to control his courtroom. It follows, therefore, that the State is also wrong in maintaining that Hull lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Act. It is an unavoidable conclusion that she is aggrieved by the Act in view of the fact that it is the only potential source of the court’s power to suspend her. Thus, we must reach the question of whether the Act constitutes an impermissible legislative encroachment on an area of judicial dominion which is beyond the control of the General Assembly.\\nThe State argues that the Act is constitutional in that it is not contrary to the disciplinary rules of the supreme court, but actually supplements them. It also claims that the statute provides a strong and effective deterrent which goes far in ensuring that no attorney will display the type of disrespect shown by Hull in the case at bar.',\n",

The decision date is (1994-02-01)\\n\\nAt the outset of our analysis, we acknowledge that the constitutionality of the Act finds some implied support in Winkleman, Moutray and Wayland by the mere fact that in those cases the supreme court did not strike the Act outright, but only limited the scope of the authority it conveyed. However, we note and consider it significant that those cases are quite dated. Since they were handed down, our supreme court has promulgated a series of rules creating a comprehensive and pervasive regulatory scheme for the discipline of members of the Illinois bar. By this scheme, we conclude that our supreme court has elected to exercise plenary and exclusive control over attorney discipline and in so doing has rendered obsolete and without any force whatsoever, any legislative enactment, such as the Act, which furthered a similar interest.\\n2\\nIn contexts other than the one at bar, the appellate court has reached the conclusion that the creation of the ARDC signalled the intent of the supreme court to make attorney discipline its exclusive concern which is not susceptible to sharing, even if the enactment can be conceded to complement the supreme court’s regulations. In In re Marriage of Dali (1991), 212 Ill. App. 3d 85, 569 N.E.2d 1131, for example, the court struck an order of a circuit court judge that censured an attorney appearing before him in an action seeking a dissolution of marriage. The attorney was sanctioned when, at a contempt hearing of his client, it was disclosed that the attorney had given his client faulty legal advice that bordered on malpractice. In its written order denying the client’s post-trial motion, the court included a sentence rebuking the attorney. The appellate court held that this constituted a censure which, like other means of professional discipline, could be imposed only by the supreme court; it therefore vacated that part of the order.',\n",

App. 3d 921, 569 N.E.2d 312, the appellate court vacated an order of the trial court which fined the State’s Attorney of Crawford County $1 for an alleged ex parte communication with a defendant’s physicians. The appellate court determined that, in the absence of a finding of contempt as a necessary precursor to the fine, it constituted an unauthorized attempt at attorney discipline by the circuit court. The court held that that power resides only in the supreme court or in another body empowered by it to serve as its agent in that capacity. The reasoning of Camden and Dali adumbrates all other appellate decisions that have reviewed the sanctioning of an attorney which was not preceded by a finding of contempt and which was issued by a court other than the supreme court. E.g., City of Chicago v. Higginbottom (1991), 219 Ill. App. 3d 602, 629, 579 N.E.2d 890 (\"It is the law of this State that the sole authority to impose disciplinary sanctions on attorneys is with the supreme court, and the appropriate forum to investigate the conduct of an attorney and conduct hearings is the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission[ ]”); Freeman v.

Yates (1988), 172 Ill. App. 3d 519, 530, 526 N.E.2d 1115, 1122 (holding that the supreme court has the exclusive and plenary jurisdiction to punish attorney misconduct, and this task may not be undertaken by lower courts except when acting as its agent).',\n",

Finley (1988), 119 Ill. 2d 485, 519 N.E.2d 898, the supreme court, although not expressly overruling its earlier decision which had countenanced some shared authority over the legal profession with the legislature, appears to have approved, at least implicitly, the contrary logic advanced by the aforementioned appellate decisions in a case reviewing the striking of a circuit court local rule. The circuit court of Cook County had promulgated a rule pursuant to the authority vested in it by Supreme Court Rule 21(a) (107 Ill. 2d R. 21(a)), which compelled plaintiffs’ attorneys in personal injury actions to attest to compliance with Supreme Court Rules 2 — 103 and 5 — 103 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. (107 Ill. 2d Rules 2 — 103, 5 — 103.) The appellate court, after determining that the supreme court had preempted all authority having to do with attorney discipline, struck the local rule even though it served to further the effectiveness of the supreme court’s own disciplinary rules. People ex rel. Brazen v. Finley (1986), 146 Ill. App. 3d 750, 497 N.E.2d 1013.\\nThe supreme court affirmed the appellate court. It held that it alone had the authority to regulate and to discipline attorneys in Illinois. The court identified the source of its power as being its exclusive authority to admit members to the bar in Illinois (see In re Mitan (1987), 119 Ill. 2d 229, 518 N.E.2d 1000; In re Application of Day (1899), 181 Ill. 73, 54 N.E. 646), and concluded that the power to admit carried with it the power to punish or to disbar and that, moreover, the power to admit being exclusive, the concomitant power to sanction must also be restricted to the body so empowered. The court deemed it irrelevant to its reasoning that the circuit court rule supplemented its own as opposed to being inconsistent therewith. Consequently, the court agreed that the rule must be invalidated as an impermissible intrusion on its indivisible authority.',\n",

The decision date is (1992-11-05)\\n\\nJUSTICE LINN\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nThe Centaur Insurance Company (Centaur) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Borg-Warner Corporation. Centaur issued numerous reinsurance policies to the Hartford Companies (Hartford). Centaur was subsequently declared insolvent and placed under the supervision of the circuit court of Cook County. The Illinois Director of Insurance was appointed the rehabilitator of Centaur.\\nIn the rehabilitation proceeding, Hartford sought a declaration that the rehabilitator did not have standing to pursue Hartford’s claims against Borg-Warner. The trial court ruled that the rehabilitator lacked standing to pursue some claims, but had standing to pursue others. The rehabilitator and Hartford each brings an interlocutory appeal from the trial court’s order.\\nWe affirm in part and reverse in part and remand.\\nBackground\\nA\\nThe record contains the following pertinent facts. In 1974, Borg-Warner created Centaur to serve as its captive insurer. Borg-Warner also allowed Centaur to do insurance and reinsurance business with entities that were not affiliated with Borg-Warner.\\nAs an insurer, Centaur issued its own insurance policies to outside entities. As a reinsurer, Centaur assumed portions of the insurance risk underwritten by outside insurance companies. In these reinsurance transactions, outside insurers paid Centaur a premium for Centaur’s agreement to indemnify the insurers against part or all of the losses that the insurers sustained on their policies. In a reinsurance transaction, an insurer that buys reinsurance from a reinsurer is designated the reinsured, or ceding company, because the reinsured cedes part or all of its risk to the reinsurer.

However, as early as 1984, Centaur had begun to default on obligations it owed to Hartford.\\nB\\nThe Illinois Director of Insurance filed a complaint in the trial court seeking an order of rehabilitation pursuant to article XIII of the Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 799 et seq.). On September 4, 1987, the trial court entered an agreed order of rehabilitation. See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 802(5).\\nThe rehabilitation order provided as follows. Centaur was declared insolvent. The Director of Insurance was appointed as rehabilitator of Centaur. He was vested with title to all of Centaur’s “property, contracts, and rights of action”; he was authorized to manage Centaur’s property and business; and he was authorized to “sue and defend for the Company, or for the benefit of the Company policyholders, shareholders and creditors.” The rehabilitator subsequently submitted a plan to rehabilitate Centaur, which the court approved on November 19,1990. See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 804(3).\\nIn a separate order (Moratorium Order) entered that day, the trial court, inter alia, enjoined all lawsuits against Centaur’s directors, officers, or stockholders. However, on January 27, 1988, the court modified the Moratorium Order and lifted the prohibition.\\nOn the same day that the prohibition was lifted, Hartford brought an action against Borg-Warner in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Hartford pled four theories of recovery: abuses of the corporate structure that justify piercing the corporate veil, fraud, reckless misrepresentation, and promissory estoppel.',\n",

The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. Hartford Casualty Insurance Co. v. Borg-Warner Corp. (7th Cir. 1990), 913 F.2d 419.\\nFollowing the dismissal of its Federal lawsuit, on October 29, 1990, Hartford brought a declaratory judgment action against Borg-Warner in the circuit court of Cook County. The complaint was nearly identical to the complaint filed in Federal court. In the declaratory judgment complaint, Hartford pled four claims. In count I, Hartford alleged that Borg-Warner abused Centaur’s corporate structure to such an extent that Centaur was merely Borg-Warner’s alter ego, which justified the piercing of Centaur’s corporate veil. In count II, Hartford alleged that Borg-Warner fraudulently misrepresented Centaur’s policyholders’ surplus in publicly filed financial reports. Count III alleged that Borg-Warner recklessly misrepresented Centaur’s financial condition in publicly filed financial reports. Count IV alleged that Borg-Warner was estopped from denying responsibility for Centaur’s obligations. Elsewhere in the record, Hartford alleged that the total losses for which Centaur will be responsible was at least $31 million.\\nOn May 8, 1991, the rehabilitator moved to intervene in Hartford’s declaratory judgment action against Borg-Warner. (See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 110, par. 2—408.) He asked the trial court to dismiss the lawsuit.

Hartford alternatively sought the appointment of a creditor’s committee to pursue estate claims against Borg-Warner. Hartford argued that the rehabilitator lacked standing for two reasons. First, Hartford’s claims against Borg-Warner are not claims that Centaur could have maintained against its parent prior to being placed in rehabilitation and, therefore, are not vested in the rehabilitator. Second, the rehabilitator is estopped from asserting that Hartford’s claims belong to the estate based on his three-year acquiescence to and support of suits against Borg-Warner, brought by Centaur’s creditors, including Hartford. The trial court granted Hartford’s motion to defer ruling on the rehabilitator’s motion to intervene in Hartford’s declaratory judgment action until after the court ruled on Hartford’s motion for a declaration in the rehabilitation proceeding.\\nOn October 17, 1991, the trial court issued a memorandum order, in which the court ruled as follows. The rehabilitator is not generally empowered to assert claims belonging to creditors, but rather, may assert only those causes of action that belonged to Centaur at the time it was placed into rehabilitation. Based on this ruling, the trial court concluded that the rehabilitator lacked standing to pursue Hartford’s alter ego claim and estoppel claim. However, the trial court further concluded that the rehabilitator had standing to pursue Hartford’s fraud claim and reckless misrepresentation claim.',\n",

The rehabilitator and Hartford each brings an interlocutory appeal from the trial court’s October 17, 1991, order. See 134 Ill. 2d Rules 303(a)(3), 304(b)(2), 307(a)(5).\\nOpinion\\nI\\nThe rehabilitator assigns error to the trial court’s ruling that he was not generally empowered to assert creditors’ claims against Borg-Warner. Rather, the rehabilitator argues that “[a]s the representative of both the company and its creditors,” he “should have the unfettered right” to pursue claims against Borg-Warner on behalf of Centaur’s policyholders and creditors. (Emphasis added.) As sources of this alleged authority, the rehabilitator cites the agreed order of rehabilitation and the subsequent revised plan of rehabilitation, and article XIII of the Insurance Code.\\nWe cannot accept the rehabilitator’s argument. Initially, we note that the trial court’s rehabilitation order and subsequent revised rehabilitation plan are not sources of the rehabilitator’s authority. Rather, article XIII of the Insurance Code establishes the position of rehabilitator, identifies the property over which a rehabilitator exercises authority, and outlines the manner in which that authority is exercised. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 799 et seq.) Since a rehabilitator derives his or her authority from the statute and cannot act against or beyond the statute, a court order does not confer on a rehabilitator any additional authority. 19A J.

(Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 803; see 19A J. Appleman, Insurance Law & Practice §10682, at 121 (rev. vol. 1982).) If the legislature had intended a rehabilitator to exercise authority over creditors’ rights of action, it could have easily so provided in the statute.\\nThe statute is consistent with long-established common law principles. Our supreme court stated the following rule over a century ago:\\n“We understand the rule to be, that where a receiver is appointed for the purpose of taking charge of the property and assets of a corporation, he is, for the purpose of determining the nature and extent of his title, regarded as representing only the corporate body itself, and not its creditors or shareholders ***. *** [F]or purposes of litigation, he takes only the rights of the corporation such as could be asserted in its own name, and that upon that basis, only, can he litigate for the benefit of either shareholders or creditors.” Republic Life Insurance Co. v. Swigert (1890), 135 Ill. 150, 167, 25 N.E. 680, 685.\\nIn Republic Life Insurance, our supreme court recognized that a receiver is generally regarded as a trustee for creditors and stockholders. However, the court explained that “ ‘this only proves that they are the beneficiaries of the fund in his hands, without indicating the sources of his title or the extent of his powers.’ ” Thus, in a controversy between a receiver and a third party regarding a corporate estate, the receiver does not represent the rights that belong to individual creditors, which the corporation could not assert in its own name. 135 Ill. at 168, 25 N.E. at 685, quoting Curtis v. Leavitt (1857), 15 N.Y. 9, 44.',\n",

The decision date is (1992-11-05)\\n\\nCourts in subsequent decisions have held that these basic principles remain the law of Illinois. (E.g., People ex rel. Barrett v. Bank of Peoria (1938), 295 Ill. App. 543, 549, 15 N.E.2d 333, 335-36; Schacht v. Brown (7th Cir. 1983), 711 F.2d 1343, 1346 n.3.) We do likewise.\\nThe rehabilitator in the case at bar is the statutory receiver of Centaur. Insurance Code section 191 vested him with “the title to all property, contracts and rights of action of the company as of the date of the order directing rehabilitation or liquidation.” (Emphasis added.) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 803.) Therefore, we uphold the trial court’s ruling that the rehabilitator may assert only those causes of action that belonged to Centaur at the time it was placed into rehabilitation.\\nA\\nThe rehabilitator continues his challenge to the trial court’s October 17, 1991, order. He assigns error specifically to the trial court’s ruling that he lacks standing to pursue Hartford’s alter ego claim.\\nA corporation is legal entity, which exists separate and distinct from its stockholders, officers, and directors, who generally are not liable for the corporation’s obligations. (Gallagher v. Reconco Builders, Inc. (1980), 91 Ill. App. 3d 999, 1004, 415 N.E.2d 560, 563.) This is true even though the corporation is a close corporation, where the stock is held in a few hands and is not frequently traded. (Gallagher, 91 Ill. App. 3d at 1004, 415 N.E.2d at 563.) This is also true even though the corporation is a subsidiary corporation, where the stock is wholly owned by a parent corporation and where the parent and subsidiary have mutual dealings. Holland v. Joy Candy Manufacturing Corp. (1957), 14 Ill. App. 2d 531, 534, 145 N.E.2d 101, 103, quoting Dregne v. Five Cent Cab Co. (1943), 381 Ill. 594, 603, 46 N.E.2d 386, 391.',\n",

App. 3d at 1004, 415 N.E.2d at 563), or “where the corporation is so organized and controlled, and its affairs so conducted, as to make it a mere instrumentality of another corporation.” (Holland, 14 Ill.

First, there must be such a unity of interest and ownership that the separate personalities of the corporation and the dominating individual or entity no longer exist. Second, the facts must be such that an adherence to the fiction of separate corporate existence would endorse a fraud or promote injustice. Gallagher, 91 Ill.

The decision date is (1992-11-05)\\n\\nThe doctrine of “piercing the corporate veil” is an equitable remedy (Tilley v. Shippee (1958), 12 Ill. 2d 616, 623, 147 N.E.2d 347, 352; 1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Corporations §41.25 (1990)); it “is not itself a cause of action but rather is a means of imposing liability on an underlying cause of action, such as a tort or breach of contract.” (1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Corporations §41, at 603 (1990).) The doctrine of alter ego fastens liability on the individual or entity that uses a corporation merely as an instrumentality to conduct that person’s or entity’s personal business. “[Sjuch liability arises from fraud or injustice perpetrated not on the corporation but on third persons dealing with the corporation. The corporate form may be disregarded only where equity requires the action to assist a third party.” (Emphasis added.) 1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Corporations §41.10, at 615 (1990); see Sinquefield v. Sears Roebuck & Co. (1991), 209 Ill.

The decision date is (1992-11-05)\\n\\nApplying these principles to the case at bar, we agree with the trial court that the rehabilitator lacks standing to pursue Hartford’s alter ego claim. The trial court correctly concluded that, under the alter ego doctrine, a subsidiary corporation cannot pierce its own corporate veil to reach a parent corporation. Rather, the equitable remedy lies with third parties such as creditors. Thus, the trial court correctly reasoned that Hartford, and not Centaur, can seek to pierce Centaur’s corporate veil under the doctrine. The trial court further reasoned that since the remedy is not available to Centaur, then it is likewise not available to the rehabilitator. We uphold the trial court’s ruling.\\nII\\nHartford assigns error to the trial court’s conclusion that the rehabilitator had standing to pursue Hartford’s fraud claim and reckless misrepresentation claim. To state a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation, a plaintiff must prove (1) that the defendant made a statement, (2) of a material nature as opposed to opinion, (3) untrue, (4) known or believed by the person making it to be untrue, or made in culpable ignorance of its truth or falsity, (5) relied upon by the victim to his detriment, (6) made for the purpose of inducing reliance, and (7) such that the victim’s reliance led to his injury. Gordon v. Dolin (1982), 105 Ill. App. 3d 319, 324, 434 N.E.2d 341, 345-46; accord Soules v. General Motors Corp. (1980), 79 Ill. 2d 282, 286, 402 N.E.2d 599, 601.\\nCiting these elements, the trial court ruled that Hartford’s fraud claim and reckless misrepresentation claim “are general claims which could be brought both by Centaur and its creditors.” The trial court reasoned that other creditors in addition to Hartford, and perhaps Centaur itself, may also have relied on Centaur’s erroneous financial reports prepared by Borg-Warner.',\n",

Selcke, Director of Insurance, State of Illinois, Respondent-Appellant and Cross-Appellee). The decision date is (1992-11-05)\\n\\nThe trial court’s analysis was incomplete. To state a cause of action for fraud, a plaintiff must show, in addition to the above-cited elements, that, under all of the circumstances, his reliance on the fraudulent misrepresentation was justified. In other words, the plaintiff must have had a right to rely on the misrepresentation. This question is answered by viewing the statements in light of all the facts of which plaintiff had actual knowledge as well as those of which she might have availed herself by exercise of ordinary prudence. Soules, 79 Ill. 2d at 286-87, 402 N.E.2d at 601; Central States Joint Board v. Continental Assurance Co. (1983), 117 Ill. App. 3d 600, 607, 453 N.E.2d 932, 936; Broberg v. Mann (1965), 66 Ill. App. 2d 134, 141, 213 N.E.2d 89, 92-93.\\nApplying all of the controlling principles to the present case, we conclude that the rehabilitator lacks standing to pursue Hartford’s fraud claim and reckless misrepresentation claim. It is true that other creditors in addition to Hartford, and Centaur itself, could alsd have relied on the erroneous financial statements. However, the tort requires each of these parties to prove that its reliance was justified, based on the particular facts that each possessed or should have possessed. In other words, each party’s claim is presumptively personal.\\nOf course, the rehabilitator can bring a fraudulent misrepresentation action in the name of Centaur. A receiver for an insurance corporation has the right to bring an action that is necessary to preserve the corporation’s assets and to recover assets of which the corporation has been wrongfully deprived through fraud. In such an action, the receiver may be said to sue also on behalf of the stockholders and creditors, but only because they are the beneficiaries of the corporation’s assets. Cotten v. Republic National Bank (Tex. Civ. App. 1965), 395 S.W.2d 930, 941; accord Republic Life Insurance, 135 Ill. at 168, 25 N.E. at 685.',\n",

The decision date is (1992-11-05)\\n\\nHowever, the rehabilitator does not seek to bring the claims in the name of Centaur. Rather, he seeks to pursue these claims on behalf of Hartford. As the court in Cotten explained:\\n“But some actions for fraud are by their nature personal to each creditor, or each stockholder, or each policyholder, and the receiver may not then maintain a suit in his representative capacity for their joint benefit. In such case each claimant and he alone may bring and maintain the suit himself, for the action is personal, separate and several, not joint, and extends no further than the individual loss of each particular creditor who sues. For example, one who proves that he relied on false representations as to the corporation’s financial condition and was thereby induced to extend credit to the corporation, or to purchase stock in it, or to take out an insurance policy with it, must in his own name maintain a separate suit for his damages against the person who uttered the fraudulent representations. The aggrieved party and he alone may maintain the suit. *** The receiver has no right to bring or maintain such a suit.” Cotten, 395 S.W.2d at 941 (and cases cited therein).\\nSee 19A J. Appleman, Insurance Law & Practice §10681, at 118 n.6 (rev. vol. 1982).\\nThe issue of whether Hartford justifiably relied on Centaur’s erroneous financial reports prepared by Borg-Warner is personal to Hartford. Since Centaur cannot maintain a fraud claim and a reckless misrepresentation claim on behalf of Hartford, neither can the rehabilitator. We reverse the trial court’s ruling that the rehabilitator had standing to pursue Hartford’s fraud claim and reckless misrepresentation claim.\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the circuit court of Cook County is affirmed in part and reversed in part and the cause remanded to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\\nAffirmed in part; reversed in part and remanded.\\nJOHNSON and McMORROW, JJ., concur.',\n",

Storage and Van Company, hereafter referred to as defendant. An arbitrator found that the injury was compensable and awarded claimant $17.63 per week for a period of twenty-five weeks for temporary total incapacity and the further sum of $681.37 for necessary medical, surgical and hospital services. Upon a review of the record made before the arbitrator, the Industrial Commission found that claimant did not sustain injuries arising out of and in the course of his employment, set aside the award of the arbitrator and dismissed the claim. The circuit court of Cook County reversed the decision of the Industrial Commission and remanded the cause to the commission, with directions to find that claimant sustained injuries arising out of and in the course of his employment and to enter an award computed on the testimony appearing in the record. Subsequently, the Industrial Commission made findings' and entered a decision and award in favor of claimant, in conformity with the mandate of the circuit court. The amount and coverage of the award was the same as previously entered by the arbitrator.

At the date of the accident, claimant was sixty-eight years old and had been engaged as a piano and furniture mover for many years, although he had been employed by defendant for only three or four months. Claimant testified that, on the morning of September 1, 1943, he was assigned to a moving van with three other men and that, while assisting them in unloading a piano, he felt a stitch in his right side and so remarked to his fellow workers. Claimant further related that after a lunch of fried ham he became sick and vomited; that when the van returned to the warehouse shortly after lunch he again vomited; that he was sick and took it easy the rest of the afternoon, and that, at quitting time, he went straight home and lay down without eating any dinner. Sometime after eight o’clock in the evening, he felt something give way on his right side. A friend took him to a local hospital where Dr. Guy Van Alstyne performed an emergency operation for strangulated hernia. Because the wound became infected, claimant experienced a slow recovery. He remained at the hospital for sixty-six days and it was twenty-five weeks before he was again able to accept employment.',\n",

The decision date is (1948-03-18)\\n\\nArchie Fournier, a witness for defendant, presented a somewhat different version of the events of September 1, 1943. Fournier was assigned to the same moving van as claimant and testified that they started the day as a three-man crew; that no piano was moved in the forenoon; that claimant became ill after lunch; that after lunch they picked up a fourth man at the warehouse and proceeded to move four rooms of furniture and an upright piano; that the only piano they moved all day was the piano in the afternoon, and that, during the afternoon, defendant carried light articles and rested much of the time. Receipts for the delivery of furniture corroborate Fournier’s testimony that the only piano they moved on September 1 was delivered in the afternoon.\\nIn October, 1943, an agent of defendant’s insurance carrier took a signed statement from claimant at the hospital. In the five-page statement, claimant made no mention of moving a piano, ascribed his sickness to the lunch of fried ham, stated that he first vomited at the warehouse, admitted a prior and similar rupture on his right side in 1910, asserted that he had experienced no pain or protrusion in either groin from the time of his operation in 1910 until the evening of September 1, 1943, and speculated that the return of the rupture was caused by a gradual weakening of the abdominal wall over the years, coupled with an upset stomach following the lunch of fried ham. On cross-examination, claimant admitted the prior hernia in 1910. He stated that the earlier injury occurred while he was moving a piano; that the .hernia was on the right side; that, after the operation, he wore a truss for six months, and that, in the intervening thirty-three years, he had no pain, protrusion or any other indication of the existence of a hernia.',\n",

The decision date is (1948-03-18)\\n\\nThe employer contends that claimant has not satisfied the statutory requirements relating to eligibility for compensation in hernia cases and that the original decision of the Industrial Commission to that effect is not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. Industrial injuries involving hernia have been singled out for special legislative consideration. Section 8(d-i) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act provides: “An injured employee, to be entitled to compensation for hernia, must prove: 1. The hernia was of recent origin; 2. Its 'appearance was accompanied by pain; 3. That it was immediately preceded by trauma arising out of and in the course of the employment; 4. That the hernia did not exist prior to the accident.” (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1947, chap. 48, par. 145.) All the concomitant circumstances and conditions prescribed by the statute must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. (Wagner Malleable Iron Co. v. Industrial Com. 358 Ill. 93; Mirific Products Co. v. Industrial Com. 356 Ill. 645; Western Electric Co. v. Industrial Com. 349 Ill. 139; Cuneo Press Co. v. Industrial Com. 341 Ill. 569.) Where the applicant fails to establish that the hernia was of recent origin and did not exist prior to the accident, no compensation may be awarded. Wagner Malleable Iron Co. v.

The decision date is (1948-03-18)\\n\\nClaimant’s frank admission that he sustained a similar hernia in the same place in 1910, taken together with the surgeon’s operative findings of a large thickened hernial sac containing unusual adhesions, points strongly to the conclusion that the hernia did exist prior to the' accident. Claimant’s argument that a hernial sac may exist without a hernia is not convincing, especially when the sac is determined to be large and thickened and to contain unusual adhesions. Claimant further contends Dr. Van Alstyne’s expert medical opinion “that there is a direct causal relation between the work the man was doing and the condition in which he found himself on September 1st, 1943,” is determinative of the issue involved. In the first place, the testimony is largely refuted by the doctor’s own operative findings. Secondly, it must be observed that the doctor did not express an opinion that the hernia did not exist prior to September 1 or state that the work required of claimant cause the hernia to appear. The condition in which claimant found himself was strangulated right inguinal hernia and it is perfectly possible that the lifting done by claimant in performance of his duties resulted in an enlargement and strangulation of a pre-existing hernia, rather than causing a new hernia to appear. The statute ignores the causal relationship between the employment and the aggravation of an old hernia and establishes the prerequisite that the employee’s work must result in a new hernia.\",\n",

On appeal defendant contends: (1) the prosecution improperly used its peremptory challenges to exclude all blacks from the jury; and (2) the trial court erred when it failed to require the United States Attorney to reveal information about an ongoing investigation of the Harvey police department which employed a key prosecution witness.\\nWe affirm defendant's convictions but remand the cause for further proceedings.\\nIt is undisputed that in the jury selection process the prosecution exercised 7 of its 10 peremptory challenges to exclude black potential jurors, with the result that the jury trying this black defendant was all white. Defense counsel asked the court to ascertain the bases for these challenges. The prosecutor responded that he was not obligated to explain them. The trial court reluctantly agreed that no such explanation was required under the State of Illinois law at that time. Given this record it is clear that defendant is entitled to a hearing pursuant to Batson v. Kentucky (1986), 476 U.S. 79, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712, and Griffith v. Kentucky (1987), 479 U.S. 314, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649, 107 S. Ct. 708. Accordingly, we must remand the cause for a Batson hearing.\\nWe next consider defendant’s contention that the court erred in failing to require the United States Attorney’s office to reveal evidence of its investigation of the Harvey police department.

According to Davis, on September 24, 1983, he was informed by another Harvey police officer, Robert Robins, that a narcotics seller was operating in downtown Harvey. At 2:45 p.m. Robins and Davis met at a downtown Harvey street corner where Robins stated that defendant would meet them at 3 p.m. Davis was in plain clothes, driving an unmarked car, but Robins was in uniform. Defendant walked up to them and told Davis he heard he was looking for drugs. According to Davis defendant then sold him, for $10, six tablets subsequently found to contain .7 grams of phenobarbital. This sale was conducted in Robins’ presence. At trial Davis denied ever seeing defendant before that date but he was impeached with his preliminary hearing testimony that he had seen him before. Davis also admitted that two different lists of prerecorded bills used in this transaction conflicted as to the denominations of bills used. On one list Davis had indicated he used a $10 bill. On the other list he indicated use of a $5 bill and five singles.\\nDavis further testified that on September 30, 1983, at 4:30 p.m. he met with defendant in the Harvey library parking lot. This meeting was observed by MEG Officers Ron Michalski and George Murray, stationed in separate surveillance cars. The defendant entered Davis’ car and after some bargaining they agreed to a sale of 30 tablets for $40. On defendant’s instructions they drove to a nearby location. Defendant went into a building and emerged with a manila envelope which he gave to Davis in return for $40. Subsequent analysis of tablets in the envelope established that they contained 3.6 grams of phenobarbital.',\n",

They arranged to meet at the Harvey public library at 1 p.m. the next day. The following day MEG agents Michalski, Murray and Wesley Thompson set up surveillance in the library parking area. Davis waited at the scene in his undercover vehicle. Defendant walked past the car, looked around, and then got in. Defendant gave Davis a manila envelope and a paper packet, describing the latter as a free sample. Davis gave him $200 and asked him to count it. Davis then gave an arrest signal, the other officers approached, and defendant was arrested after a scuffle. The manila envelope was subsequently found to contain 11.9 grams of phenobarbital.\\nThe State did not present the testimony of Robins, the uniformed police officer who allegedly participated in the first drug purchase. The State did, however, present the testimony of two of the three surveillance officers, Michalski and Thompson. Michalski testified that on September 30 he saw defendant enter Davis’ car and then saw the two men drive to the nearby YMCA. Defendant went into that building for 10 minutes and then walked up to Davis’ car and leaned in Davis’ open window. Contrary to Davis’ testimony concerning the delivery of a manila envelope, Michalski stated that he saw nothing in defendant’s hand. Davis subsequently showed him the manila envelope containing pills.\\nMichalski testified that he also observed the October 4 incident. He saw the defendant walk past Davis’ car, look in all directions, and then enter the car. Two minutes later Davis gave the arrest signal.

After the arrest signal was given, defendant hit his head on the side of the car while resisting arrest.\\nDefendant, 56 years old at the time of trial, testified that he lived at the YMCA Senior Citizen’s Home in Harvey. As the result of a series of strokes he walked with a cane and had a speech impediment. His doctors had prescribed phenobarbital and dilantin because of his seizures. According to defendant, one of his hobbies was to go to Harvey city council meetings and criticize “bum politicians.” He had frequently criticized the Harvey police department. In the last election defendant, while campaigning for a candidate, was accused by a citizen of being drunk, apparently because of his speech impediment. He went to the police and informed them of his medical use of phenobarbital.\\nDefendant testified that in September 1983 he showed Officer Jackson an advance copy of a letter he was submitting for publication to a local newspaper. Officer Davis interrupted their conversation to ask what defendant had against Harvey police chief Bruce Terry. The letter was subsequently published and was submitted into evidence, although it has not been included in the record on appeal.\\nDefendant testified that on September 24, 1983, he was sitting on a park bench when Officer Robins approached, saying he wanted defendant to meet someone. He then introduced Davis to him. Davis asked defendant if he knew where he could get some pills. However, defendant rebuffed this, telling Davis he knew where he could get “a good killing.”\\nWith respect to the September 30 encounter, defendant testified that Davis approached him from Davis’ car and again asked about obtaining drugs.

Defendant’s counsel filed a subpoena duces tecum, on the United States Attorney’s office seeking “[a]ny and all reports, notes, memos, etc., concerning any and all investigations” of Davis, Michalski, and Thompson. The United States Attorney’s office sought to quash the subpoena, citing in part the need to protect its ongoing investigation and its informants. Defendant’s counsel then requested that the court examine the materials in camera to determine their relevance. The trial court, however, only required that office to disclose any material directly related to the police conduct in defendant’s case. The United States Attorney’s office acceded to this request, subsequently informing the court that it had no such information.\\nWe find that, as to any Federal record relating to Andre Davis, the court abused its discretion in summarily narrowing the scope of the subpoena without availing itself of an in camera inspection. (See Marshall v. Elward (1980), 78 Ill. 2d 366, 399 N.E.2d 1329.) In this cause the key State evidence came from Andre Davis. The other officers who testified could only corroborate the facts of the meeting with defendant. They witnessed none of the alleged drug exchanges. The one officer who, according to Davis, participated in one of the drug transactions while in uniform was Robert Robins, and he was not called to testify by the State. As we have noted, the trial court found this aspect of the State’s case troublesome.',\n",

The decision date is (1888-08-08)\\n\\nThe contract between appellant and appellee provided no method of ascertaining the cost of any part of the stock of goods. The phrase, “ and as agreed upon,” clearly refers to the estimate of §747.09 for show cases, etc., and nothing else. The appellee denies that any verbal agreement was made as to the manner of ascertaining the cost. When the dispute arose between them as to the cost of the cotton bats, Young insisted that he would go no further unless the original bills were produced, and as they were not produced he at once left the store, saying ho was done. He could not arbitrarily rescind the contract. The failure to specify in the agreement any particular mode of fixing upon the cost, did not warrant him in saying he would have the bills or abandon the trade. If he was entitled to any evidence of cost, certainly he could not demand that which was not in the power of Kendall to furnish. There was an implied undertaking on Kendall’s part to produce such evidence in his power as is usual between merchants in ascertaining the cost price of a stock of goods, and such as he could produce without unreasonable labor or delay, and his refusal to produce the same as to any substantial part of the goods, on request of Young, would have amounted to a breach of the contract on his part; but Young had no right to elect the character of evidence that would satisfy him and refuse to proceed unless it was presented. If lie wanted the benefit of a condition like that he should have had it inserted in the contract. He was a man of large experience in handling the goods he proposed to purchase, and may have intended to rely on his experience to save him from any overreaching in fixing the cost price. Whatever inference may be drawn from his failure to require such a stipulation, it is plain that the contract did not save to him the privilege of rescinding unless the original bills were produced.

Hudson was the owner of the land in his lifetime, and the question in the case is whether he conveyed it, after the death of himself and his wife, to Clifton A. Hudson. Prior to and on July 27, 1912, John H. Hudson was the owner of about 665 acres of land in Champaign county and some lots in the city of Urbana, and his wife, Eliza E. Hudson, was the owner of 80 acres of land. It is the contention of the appellees that Hudson and his wife on July 27, 1912, decided to partition their estate among their children, retaining the use of it during their respective lives, and executed deeds for that purpose. Clifton A. Hudson was their son, and they had seven other children, one of whom (Oscar) lived in Minnesota upon a farm for which his father had helped him to pay and expected to make further payments. Eor this reason, in the partition made on the 27th of July, 1912, nothing was given to him, but it is claimed that a deed was made to each of the other seven children, by which all the real estate of John H. and Eliza E. Hudson was conveyed to them; that the deeds were delivered to G. W. Webber, cashier of the First National Bank of Urbana, to be kept until after the death of both the grantors and then delivered to the respective grantees, but that subsequently John H. Hudson obtained the deed made to Clifton and destroyed it. John H. Hudson died March 7, 1916, leaving a will, by which he purported to devise to Clifton a life estate in 60 acres of the land alleged to have been conveyed to Clifton and the lots in Urbana, with remainder to Frederick M. Hudson, and a life estate in the remaining 20 acres to John M. Hudson, with remainder to John Howard Hudson. The deeds of the other real estate of John H. and Eliza E. Hudson were found in the custody of the bank, but there was no deed to Clifton. Clifton made a conveyance to his daughter of the real estate claimed to have been conveyed to him by his father, retaining a life estate in himself, and thereupon they filed',\n",

The decision date is (1919-02-20)\\n\\nIt appears from the testimony that in the summer of 1912 John H. Hudson called upon Judge Cunningham, a lawyer living in the city of Urbana, of many years’ practice though not then keeping an office, and consulted him about making some disposition of his real estate in view of his death, which he anticipated was near. He said he wanted to make some deeds to his children and lay them aside, not to be delivered until after his death. Cunningham told him that they must be delivered during his lifetime, otherwise they might be set aside, and Hudson was about to give up the plan and make a will, but, after some conversation about what could be done, Cunningham told him that he could make the deeds, place them in the hands of someone to be delivered after his death, but not to be interfered with by him and entirely beyond his control, and that would be a legal delivery. Hudson finally assented to this and the deeds were prepared. Hudson gave Cunningham the names of his children and the pieces of property he wanted them to have. He named the property that he wished to have conveyed to the different members of his family. He told Cunningham how many children he had and spoke of one or more of them being absent. Cunningham’s recollection was that he intended to convey his entire property. The deeds were all made upon the same form, and while Cunningham did not remember the particular language of the deeds to the different grantees, his recollection was that the general provisions of the deeds, outside of the description of the property, were the same. He remembered one of the names in particular was Clifton or Clifford, but did not remember exactly which. No different direction was given as to the deed to Clifton or Clifford from the direction as to the other deeds. Cunningham did not know whether the property was approximately evenly divided or was unevenly divided and did not know how much property or what property was described in the deed to Clifton.

He did not remember whether Hudson was reserving any part of his property from the deeds. Cunningham went to Hudson’s house with the deeds ready for execution and then came down to the bank with Mr. and Mrs. Hudson, where the deeds were acknowledged by them before Roger P. Little, a lawyer and notary public, who testified to the circumstances of the acknowledgment of the deeds but was not able to state the number of them. The deeds were then placed in an envelope, on which was the following typewritten indorsement: “Deeds of John H. Hudson and his wife, Eliza E. Hudson, now sealed and to be kept sealed until after the decease of both, then by the custodian to be opened and delivered to each grantee, the delivery in this form to the custodian to be considered as a delivery of the deed in legal form.” The envelope was sealed and the package was then delivered to G. W. Webber, the cashier of the bank, who indorsed in writing below the typewritten indorsement these words: “Received July 30th, 1912.—G. W. Webber, Cashier.” The package was put by the cashier in a safety deposit box, where it remained until some time later, when Hudson came to the bank and asked for the package. He told Fay, the president of the bank, that he wanted the package to make some change and would bring it back, and Fay gave it to him. It was still sealed but when.it was returned it was torn open. After its return the package remained in the bank in the same box in which it had been previously kept until after Hudson’s death, when it was found to contain the six deeds to the other children, not including Oscar or Clifton.',\n",

Hudson consulted Judge Cunningham about the disposition of his real estate by making deeds to his children, and after Cunningham informed him of the necessity of an actual delivery of the deeds and they had discussed the question of making a will it was decided that the deeds should be executed, and this was done. Each of the seven deeds recites that it, with six others of the same date, all made by the grantors to. their children, is made as anticipating a partition of their estate among their children. The recital in the will refers to these samé deeds, stating that by them tire testator and his wife have partitioned among their children all of their real estate, but that their son Oscar received no part of such real estate for the reason which was stated. It is true that in the new will'which was written it is also recited that Clifton received no part of the real estate by the deeds mentioned, but this recital is inconsistent with the previous recital that the testator and his wife had partitioned among their children all of their real estate and with the devise of certain real estate to Clifton and John, which, if the previous recitals are true, was intluded in the partition of July 27, 1912. There was no other devise of real estate after the death of the wife except these two, but the will refers to the partition of the estate as an accomplished fact, and urges upon the children of the testator acquiescence therein without words of complaint or thought of injustice, declaring the deeds to be delivered and the titles conveyed. The deeds which were executed on July 27, 1912, were all placed in one envelope and delivered to the custodian to be held for the grantees.

Hudson obtained the package, saying he wanted to make some change and would bring it back. He returned it broken open, and it then contained the six deeds unchanged. Why did he break open the package? The change which he wished to make was not made in any of the six deeds. It must have referred to something else. If he did make any change it must have been with reference to the seventh deed. On the cross-examination of the witness who drew the will it appeared that the testator told him that he had become angry with Clifton’s wife and daughter and had determined that they should not take the property given them in the will, and this may have been the motive upon which he acted when he went to the bank and got the package containing the deeds. Mrs. Hudson testified she did not sign any deed to Clifton and no deed was made to him. She said she did not read the deeds she signed; that she did not count the deeds, did not know that the deeds signed stated that there were seven of them, and did not know how many were sealed up and left at the bank. She was seventy-three years old at the time she testified, had been sick and under the constant care of a nurse for more than a year, and her testimony was about a transaction which occurred four or five years before she testified, in which her part was apparently passive, Judge Cunningham’s conferences and discussions having been with her husband, only. She gave no reason why no deed was made to Clifton in the partition of the property, and her denial of the execution of such a deed is so inconsistent with the purpose which she and her husband had in view in making the deeds that her denial is not entitled to any considerable weight.',\n",

The decision date is (1919-02-20)\\n\\nIt appears from a preponderance of the evidence that seven deeds were executed on July 27, 1912, and that Clifton A. Hudson was the grantee in the missing deed. All the deeds that were executed were delivered or none of them were delivered. They were placed together in a sealed package and delivered to a custodian. The instrudtions given to the custodian applied to all the deeds alike. The typewritten indorsement on the envelope expressly declared that the delivery to the custodian was to be considered as a legal delivery of the deeds and that they were to be kept sealed until after the decease of John H. Hudson and his wife and then to be opened by the custodian and delivered to the grantees. Webber, to whom the package was delivered, stated that Judge Cunningham said they would like to have the papers put away, and referred to the typewritten indorsement on the envelope and said they would like to have the papers kept by the bank. The package was sealed when Webber first saw it and had a typewritten indorsement upon it, which he says he probably read over, though he had no recollection of reading it and did not recall the language that was used by Judge Cunningham when he referred to it or what was said as to whether the directions were to be followed.',\n",

The decision date is (1919-02-20)\\n\\nThe question of the delivery of the deeds depends upon the question of the intention of the grantors when they were delivered to Webber. If they then intended to part with their custody and control and to have them take effect as conveyances they were delivered. In view of the express purpose of making the deeds, of the discussion in regard to making the will, of the advice of the attorney as to the necessity of a delivery and of retaining no control over the deeds, of the typewritten indorsement on the envelope, which could have been placed there for no other purpose than to express the testator’s intention, there can be no doubt as to the intention of John H. Hudson when the deeds were placed in the possession of Webber. A subsequent change of intention could not affect the delivery thus completed, and even a mental reservation of the testator contrary to that expressed by his words and deeds, existing only in his own mind, would not invalidate the delivery effected by his acts and the words actually used. The custodian, on the receipt of the deeds with the instructions of the grantors, held them for the benefit of the grantees, and he had. no right to surrender them to the grantors and the grantors had no right to receive them. Webber did not surrender them to the grantors but they were obtained from another officer of the bank who had no knowledge of the original transaction and did not know what was contained in the envelope. Unless the deeds were all delivered on July 27, 1912, none of them were ever delivered and John H. Hudson died intestate as to all his real estate except a life estate to his wife and the property devised to Clifton and John M. Hudson by the fifth and sixth clauses of his will. The will recognizes the delivery of the deeds as an accomplished fact, but the language of the will did not itself constitute a delivery or a devise.

The will speaks only from the testator’s death and was subject to revocation during his lifetime.

The decision date is (1919-02-20)\\n\\nThe direct evidence as to the contents of the deed is somewhat vague and uncertain. No one testified directly to the contents. No one testified who had read the deed except Judge Cunningham, who drew it, yet the circumstantial evidence is sufficiently definite as to the property described in the deed. It is admitted that John H. Hudson and his wife owned about 665 acres of land in Champaign county and some lots in the city of Urbana. They undertook to dispose of all of this property by their deeds. Hudson’s will stated that he had partitioned all of his real estate among his children by these deeds. It is not claimed that the other six deeds do not dispose of all of this property except the 80 acres and the lots claimed by the appellees. Therefore, if the deeds disposed of all of the property of Hudson and his wife, the deed to Clifton must have disposed of the 80 acres and the lots. The terms of the. deed are not capable of such definite proof. All the deeds were drawn on the same form, they were all ordinary statutory warranty deeds, and each contained the recital of the execution of the other six deeds in substantially the language which has already been given. This language had no effect to limit the estate granted to less than a fee simple. The statement that a life estate, only, was intended, and that should the grantees die before the death of the grantors, or at the death of the grantees, the title should vest in their legal heirs, had no such effect. Under the rule in Shelley’s case such an estate is a fee simple in the first grantee. So the limitation that the grantee in his lifetime should not make any disposal of the fee and that his interest should not become liable for his debts was of no effect, because such a condition cannot be attached to a conveyance in fee. The recital, therefore, had no effect on the estate granted and was only expressive of the purpose of the grantors in making the deeds. Clifton A. Hudson, being one of the seven children to',\n",

The recital, therefore, had no effect on the estate granted and was only expressive of the purpose of the grantors in making the deeds. Clifton A. Hudson, being one of the seven children to whom deeds were made, was a grantee in this destroyed deed, and the estate granted .to him was a fee simple unless there was some language in the deed limiting it to a less estate or some charge imposed upon the estate. One óf the six deeds which have not been destroyed limited the remainder after the life estate to the grantee to his son by name, and another required the payment of $1000 by the grantee. There was no evidence that there was any such limitation or charge in the deed to Clifton, but the appellees have not produced any evidence that there was not, and in this respect the evidence is uncertain. However, this deed was taken by the grantor, without authority, from the custodian, who held it for the grantee, and has not been produced. In view of all the circumstances shown in the case it was probably intentionally destroyed by the grantor for the purpose of destroying its effect as a conveyance. The defendants are volunteers, claiming through the grantor, and have no greater rights than he had. It is a rule of evidence that everything will be presumed against the despoiler. Where a party to a suit has intentionally destroyed material evidence in a case every presumption will be indulged against him. This presumption does not relieve the opposite party from the burden of proving his case, but it does have' the effect, where the evidence is vague and uncertain, of raising a presumption against the party who has destroyed the evidence which would make the facts clear. In this case it is shown that Hudson and his wife executed a warranty deed of certain property to Clifton and that subsequently the grantor destroyed it.

Having destroyed it, it is he who must suffer the inconvenience from the loss of the evidence and not the grantee.

The decision date is (1919-02-20)\\n\\nWhile the appellants here are not shown themselves to have been guilty of the destruction of the deed they are in no better position than the grantor and testator. If the suit had been against him the presumption against the despoiler of evidence would prevail, and his voluntary grantees are in no better position. “The presumption in odium spoliatoris is perfectly legitimate. It is so natural and so just that it is a part of every civilized code.” (Bryant v. Stidwell, 24 Pa. 314.) The familiar illustration of the nature of the presumption is found in Armory v. Delamirie, 1 Strange, 505, (1 Smith’s L. C. 7th Am. ed. 636,) where a chimney sweep having found a jewel took it to the shop of the defendant, a goldsmith, to learn what it was. The stones having been removed the goldsmith offered the sweep a small sum in payment, and upon his refusal to accept such payment gave him back the socket without the stones.' In an action of trover the jury were instructed “that unless the defendant did produce the jewel and show it not to be of the finest water they should presume the strongest against him and make the value of the best jewels the measure of their damages, which they accordingly did.” In regard to the suppression of documents the rule was stated in Rector v. Rector, 3 Gilm. 105, to be, that when a party refuses to produce books and papers his opponent may give secondary or parol proof of their contents, if they are shown to be in the possession of the opposite party, and if such secondary evidence is imperfect, vague and uncertain as to dates, sums, boundaries, etc., every intendment and presumption shall be against the party who might remove all doubt by producing the higher evidence. In Anderson v. Irwin, 101 Ill. 411, (a bill to establish a will which had been destroyed by some of the defendants after the testator’s death,) it was held that all that could be required of the complainant, under the circumstances, was to show in general terms the disposition which\",\n",

The court said: “In view of all the facts we think the maxim omnia prcesumuntur contra spoliatorem may properly be applied to this case. In applying this maxim the rule seems to be well settled that where one deliberately destroys, or purposely induces another to destroy, a written instrument of any kind, and the contents of such instrument subsequently become a matter of judicial inquiry between the spoliator and an innocent party, the latter will not be required to make strict proof of the contents of such instrument in order to establish a right founded thereon.

Black, 197 Ill. 53, where it is said: “When parol proof of the existence and contents of a lost deed is offered as the only evidence thereof, the witness must have seen and read it and be able to speak pointedly and clearly as to its tenor and contents, and to state whether it conveys a fee simple, a life estate or a term for years, and whether it in fact was executed by the supposed grantor.” This language was appropriate to that case, but it is too broad in laying down a rule of universal application which ignores the presumption against the destroyer of evidence and would exclude proof by circumstantial evidence, no matter of how great a degree of certainty. The rule as to the certainty required in the proof, by parol, of lost or destroyed documents must be considered in connection with the maxim that everything will be presumed against the despoiler, otherwise, as suggested in Anderson v.

In Shackelton v. Sebree, 86 Ill. 616, it was held that a deed containing the following recital by the grantor: “This deed not to take effect until after my decease,—not to be recorded until after my decease,” was effective as a present conveyance of the fee after the grantor’s death and that no particular estate of freehold was necessary to support it. A\"grantor may convey the fee in his land beginning at-a future time, and the time of the commencement of the estate may be fixed by his death or may be at any arbitrary date before or after his death, or may be fixed by reference to such circumstances as the grantor may choose. Subject to the fee thus granted the grantor will retain for himself and his heirs and grantees the ownership of the land and the right to possess and use it. So in White v. Willard, 232 Ill. 464, a deed was held to convey the fee in which a life estate was reserved to the grantor and his wife, and it was expressly stated that the title of the grantees should become absolute only upon the death of both. A deed which states upon its face that it is not to take effect until the grantor’s death will be sustained as a present grant of a future estate if it has actually been delivered, and it is not subject to the objection that it is a testamentary disposition of property.

J.\\nThis is an appeal from a decree of divorce rendered against appellant on the ground of adultery. Appellee’s bill as originally filed, charged desertion only. Before the depositions of witnesses were taken, the bill was so amended as to charge adultery with aperson named, at various times and on various occasions “from December 1, 1885, to November 1, 1886,” at a certain street and number in the city of St. Louis and State of Missouri. It was shown on the hearing that appellant was not in St. Louis during the time stated in the bill, but the testimony of the witnesses, which was clearly sufficient to prove the adultery, tended to fix the date a year or more earlier than that laid in the bill, at which earlier date appellant was in St. Louis. Appellant in his deposition did not deny adultery, and seems to have relied on appellee’s inability to prove it at the dates alleged in the bill. On the hearing the chancellor allowed the bill to be so amended as to bring the allegation into accord with the proof, and directed that the answer of appellant stand as an answer to the amended bill. Thereupon appellant’s solicitor asked for a continuance, but offered no affidavit in support of his request. The court denied the continuance and directed a decree for appellee.\\nAppellant contends that the court had no power to direct that the answer on file should stand as an answer to the amended bill.',\n",

It appears from the petition that at the April election for trustees of schools, in 1895, the proposition for or against establishing a township high school in said township was submitted to a vote of the people, resulting in a majority vote for the proposition. Defendants filed a plea to the information, setting up that they were subsequently duly elected to the office of members of the school board of said high school. A demurrer was filed to this plea, upon the ground that it failed to show that the proposition for or against the high school was voted upon in the manner provided by the act in force July 1, 1891, known as the “Australian Ballot law.” The circuit court overruled the demurrer and dismissed the petition, and this is an appeal from that judgment.',\n",

It is contended, however, on behalf of appellant, that, notwithstanding this fact, the proposition for or against a high school is a “public measure,” within the meaning of section 16, supra, as construed in County of Union v. Ussery, 147 Ill. 204, and that it could therefore only be legally voted upon in conformity with that section. The question here, however, is whether, in view of section 1 of the Ballot law and the foregoing provisions of the School law, it was the intention of the legislature to require the election for the establishment of a high school to be conducted under the former. We think no such intention appears. In the first place, no provision whatever is made in the Ballot law for providing ballots for such an election. The 15th section of that act provides as follows: “For all elections to which this act applies, the county clerks, in their respective counties, shall have charge of the printing of the ballots for all general elections, and shall furnish them to the judges of election. The city, town or village clerk shall have charge thereof and furnish them in all city ■ elections, and the town clerk in counties under township organization shall have charge thereof and furnish the same in all town elections to which this act applies. ” It further provides that the officer so charged with printing the ballots shall cause to be delivered a certain number of the same to the judges of elections, etc. No provision, here or elsewhere in the act, is made for printing and distributing ballots for school elections, and it is therefore clear that the legislature, by providing, as we have seen, for the printing and distributing of ballots “for',\n",

It cannot be seriously contended that a proper ballot for the election of trustees of schools would, under section 1 of the Ballot law, be in conformity with the provisions of that act, and hence the legislature, by saying that the proposition for or against the establishment of a high school may be upon the same ballot upon which is the name of the person or persons whom the voter desires for trustee or trustees, has, in effect, said that an Australian ballot could not be used.in voting upon the proposition for or against the high school.

This Court reversed from the bench during oral argument.\\nThe petition for revocation alleged that defendant failed to report to the probation officer and was absent from the State. The record discloses that at the hearing on revocation, defendant’s appointed counsel stated:\\n“The defendant wishes to admit, Your Honor, to the violations as set forth in both of the reports of the probation officer.”\\nThe court then imposed sentence following a short statement in mitigation by counsel.\\nIn People v. Pier, 51 Ill.2d 96, 281 N.E.2d 289, revocation of probation and imposition of sentence was founded only upon an admission of the violations alleged. In considering issues raised in post-conviction proceedings, the court said:\\n“Justice demands that he also be entitled to the protection of the same due-process requirements which pertain to pleas of guilty when he waives his right to a judicial determination of the charge that he violated his probation and confesses or admits the charges of the revocation petition.”\\nThe due process requirements pertaining to pleas of guilty are contained in Supreme Court Rule 402. Paragraph (e) of the Rule provides:\\n“Transcript Required. In cases in which the defendant is charged with a crime punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, the proceedings required by this rule to be in open court shall be taken verbatim, transcribed, filed, and made a part of the common-law record.”\\nThis record fails to demonstrate that the requirements of Pier or of Rule 402(e) have been satisfied.\\nIn People v.

SUPERIOR BANK FSB, Defendant-Appellant (Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Trustee, et al., Defendants). The decision date is (1995-03-31)\\n\\nJUSTICE THEIS\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nThe plaintiff, Firstmark Standard Life Insurance Company (First-mark), and the defendant, Superior Bank FSB (Superior), both held mortgages on real estate commonly identified as 222 North Michigan Avenue. This real estate was the res of a land trust. After the trust defaulted on its loan, Firstmark filed a complaint seeking foreclosure; subsequently, Superior likewise sought foreclosure. Pursuant to section 2 — 1005 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 110, par. 2 — 1005.) The trial court granted Firstmark’s motion and denied Superior’s motion. Superior appeals the decision of the trial court, contending that the trial court erred in failing to apply the doctrine of conventional subrogation to give Superior’s mortgage priority over that of Firstmark. We affirm the decision of the trial court.\\nThe facts in this matter are, for the most part, undisputed. At the center of this appeal is the priority of mortgages held on a piece of commercial real estate in downtown Chicago. The property commonly known as 222 North Michigan Avenue was the res of a land trust under a trust agreement dated October 20, 1980, with Harris Trust and Savings Bank as trustee. Since 1981, ownership of the beneficial interest of the trust was transferred between four companies, all primarily owned by one individual, Richard Fanslow. The companies were Life Assurance Company of Pennsylvania (LACOP), Virick Limited (Virick), Nurses Guaranteed Retirement Life Insurance Company (Nurses), and N.R. Guaranteed Retirement, Inc. (N.R.). The record shows that by 1983, the property was subject to three mortgages. These three prior mortgages amounted to a sum which totalled over $3 million.',\n",

(This mortgage is hereinafter referred to as the Firstmark mortgage.) The mortgage was recorded in Cook County on November 28, 1983.\\nIn December of 1985, the trust executed a second promissory note, for the amount of $7.1 million. This note was made in favor of Lyons Savings and Loan Association, succeeded in interest by Superior Bank.\\nThis note was also secured by a mortgage, which we will refer to as the \"Superior mortgage.” The mortgage contains the following clause:\\n\"3.1 Representations as to the Mortgaged Premises. Mortgagor represents and covenants that: A. Mortgagor is the holder of the fee simple title to the Mortgaged Premises subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances ***.”\\nAttached to this mortgage is exhibit B, a schedule of permitted encumbrances.

Superior appeals the decision of the court.\\nThe issue on this appeal essentially amounts to a determination of which party holds the superior interest in this property. Before we address this issue, we must consider Firstmark’s contentions that consideration of the priority of the mortgages is barred by collateral estoppel and judicial admissions.\\nInitially, Firstmark argues that consideration of this issue is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. In a related bankruptcy proceeding, to which both Firstmark and Superior were parties, the bankruptcy court dismissed the petition of N.R. (the beneficial owner of the property), finding that it had not been filed in good faith. In reaching this conclusion, the bankruptcy court incidentally stated that Firstmark had a first mortgage and Superior had the junior mortgage.\\nHowever, in the bankruptcy matter, Firstmark and Superior were not called upon to litigate the issue before this court — the priority of their mortgages. Determining which party held the superior mortgage was not essential to the bankruptcy court’s resolution of the issues before it; the matter of the priority of the mortgages was merely incidentally discussed. \" \\'[C]ollateral estoppel does not apply to issues that might have been decided but were not, nor to matters incidentally decided that were not essential to support the judgment in the prior action.’ ” (Lester v. Arlington Heights Federal Savings & Loan Association (1985), 130 Ill. App. 3d 233, 239, 474 N.E.2d 33, 37, quoting Godare v. Sterling Steel Casting Co. (1981), 103 Ill. App. 3d 46, 50, 430 N.E.2d 620.) Therefore, this action is not precluded by collateral estoppel.',\n",

SUPERIOR BANK FSB, Defendant-Appellant (Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Trustee, et al., Defendants). The decision date is (1995-03-31)\\n\\nFirstmark also contends that consideration of Superior’s appeal is barred because Superior itself labelled Firstmark’s mortgage a \"first mortgage” in a series of papers filed with the Federal courts during the conduct of the bankruptcy proceedings. Firstmark argues that Superior’s actions in the earlier case amount to a judicial admission. However, a judicial admission does not include an admission made during the course of another court proceeding; such an admission is only an evidentiary admission. (See Anfinsen Plastic Molding Co. v. Konen (1979), 68 Ill. App. 3d 355, 386 N.E.2d 108; M. Graham, Cleary & Graham’s Handbook of Illinois Evidence § 802.11 (6th ed. 1994).) Therefore, because Superior’s statements in the bankruptcy case were not admissions made during the conduct of this case, we cannot now consider them as judicial admissions.\\nHaving disposed of these two preliminary issues, we turn to the main issue on this appeal: the priority of the mortgages.\\nA mortgage becomes effective when it is recorded. This is a long-standing rule that has been codified in our statutes:\\n\"All deeds, mortgages and other instruments of writing which are authorized to be recorded, shall take effect and be in force from and after the time of filing the same for record, and not before, as to all creditors and subsequent purchasers, without notice.” Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 30, par. 29.\\nIt is likewise long established that this rule gives rise to a presumption that the first mortgage recorded has priority. (See, e.g., Delano v. Bennett (1878), 90 Ill. 533.) In this case, Firstmark’s mortgage was recorded on November 28, 1983. Superior’s mortgage was not recorded until December 30,1985, more than two years later. By virtue of the recording dates, then, Firstmark clearly possessed a first mortgage.',\n",

The trial court declined to apply the doctrine of conventional subrogation, finding that the State of Illinois requires a written agreement to support a claim of conventional subrogation.\\nTo resolve this issue, we are aided by only a handful of decisions from this State; most were decided many years before.

SUPERIOR BANK FSB, Defendant-Appellant (Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Trustee, et al., Defendants). The decision date is (1995-03-31)\\n\\nIn 1897, the Illinois Supreme Court discussed the doctrine of conventional subrogation, defining its limits. \"[T]here exists another principle, which is termed conventional subrogation, which results from an equitable right springing from an express agreement with the debtor, by which one advances money to pay a claim for the security of which there exists a lien, by which agreement he is to have an equal lien to that paid off, whereupon he is entitled to the benefit of the security which he has satisfied with the expectation of receiving an equal lien.” (Home Savings Bank v. Bierstadt (1897), 168 Ill. 618, 624, 48 N.E. 161, 162.) Therefore, the court indicated that, before applying the doctrine of conventional subrogation, it must find that an express agreement exists. \"It is the agreement that the security shall be kept alive for the benefit of the person making the payment which gives the right of subrogation, because it takes away the character of a mere volunteer.” (Bierstadt, 168 Ill. at 624, 48 N.E. at 162.) The court concluded that, where no injury results to the innocent party, equity will effectuate the true intention of the parties through use of the doctrine of conventional subrogation.\\nIn Kaminskas v. Cepauskis (1938), 369 Ill. 566, 17 N.E.2d 558, the only issue on appeal was the relative priority of a mortgage lien and the dower rights of a previously undisclosed wife living in Lithuania. The court determined that the mortgage was superior to the wife’s dower rights. The court noted that it would work a hardship and an injustice to subordinate the mortgage broker’s rights to those of the wife and therefore it decided to give effect to the \"express agreement” between Frank Cepauskis and the mortgage broker. \"Reason and justice both demand that the agreement be given effect.” Kaminskas, 369 Ill. at 571, 17 N.E.2d at 561.',\n",

Arnove (1943), 318 Ill. App. 261, 47 N.E.2d 874, Kankakee Federal loaned to Arnove a sum of money which was secured by a mortgage on the property. Arnove’s daughters also claimed an interest in the property. There was testimony to support the allegation that, at the time the mortgage was made, Arnove asserted that his daughters claimed no interest in the property and that if there were such an interest, it would be subordinated to the mortgage holder’s. With these assurances, the loan was closed. The court concluded that the testimony showed no intention on the part of the mortgage holder to release or affect its right to a prior lien and it was only upon the assurances of Arnove to that effect that the loan was made. Therefore, because there appeared to be an agreement to the contrary, the court concluded that the law of conventional subrogation preserved the priority of the old mortgage.\\nIn Western United Dairy Co. v. Continental Mortgage Co. (1960), 28 Ill. App. 2d 132, 170 N.E.2d 650, the court discussed the doctrine of conventional subrogation at length and defined it in the following manner: \"Conventional subrogation gives a third party, who loans a landowner money with which to discharge a prior lien, with the express (though not necessarily written) agreement that the third party will then be in the position of the prior lienor, priority over intervening lienors to the extent of the discharged lien.” Western United, 28 Ill. App. 2d at 135, 170 N.E.2d at 651.\\nThe linchpin of all these cases, then, is the existence of an express agreement that the interests of a subsequent mortgagor are to be advanced to a first mortgage. It therefore follows that the courts in Illinois have been unwilling to apply the doctrine of conventional subrogation on the basis of an implied agreement.',\n",

The decision date is (1995-03-31)\\n\\nOur review of the record does not reveal the existence of an express agreement to elevate Superior’s mortgage to a first mortgage. However, Superior argues that, when read together, several documents contained in the record indicate that there was an agreement that Superior receive a first mortgage. Superior asks us to consider the title insurance policy and its accompanying escrow agreements as \"grounds to find the existence of an agreement.”\\nThe title insurance policy and its accompanying documents do not expressly state that Superior is to receive a first mortgage. Instead, the escrow agreements state that the title insurance policy would insure against Superior’s \"loss by reason of defects in the title *** either without mention of [the Firstmark mortgage] or insuring against loss by reason [of the Firstmark mortgage].” The escrow documents further indicate that the beneficial owner was to deposit the full amount of the Firstmark mortgage in an account with Intercounty Title Company of Illinois to be held in escrow. We fail to see how this type of title insurance policy can lead to the conclusion that there was an agreement that Superior was to receive a first mortgage.\\nSuperior makes no attempt to explain the clear language of its mortgage. The Superior mortgage, entered into at the same time that the title insurance policy was procured, specifically states that the mortgage was subject to the Firstmark mortgage. Consequently, at the time Superior made its loan, it expressly agreed to not a first mortgage, as it contends, but a junior mortgage.\\nTherefore, we cannot find that there was any evidence of an agreement that Superior was to have its interests subrogated. None of the arguments raised in Superior’s brief have convinced us otherwise. We therefore refuse to apply the doctrine of conventional subrogation and we affirm the decision of the trial court.\\nAffirmed.\\nHOFFMAN, P.J., and S. O’BRIEN, J„ concur.',\n",

Hutchings, appellant, widow of William H. Hutchings, deceased, claimed a widow’s award in the County Court of Fulton county, Illinois, where such proceedings were had that an appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of that county where there was a trial which resulted in a holding to the effect that the appellant was not entitled to any award, upon the ground that she was not “residing in this state,” as required by section 74 of chapter 3 of the Revised Statutes of Illinois. Ella R. Hutchings brings the case to this court by appeal.\\nAppellant contends that at the time of the death of William JET. Hutchings, he was a resident of the State of Illinois and that his domicile was the domicile of his wife, and therefore she was, in contemplation of the statute, a resident of the State of Illinois, although she had kept house in St. Louis for over a year prior to his death and was residing there at the time of his death, and cites in support of that contention the case of Hayes v. Hayes, 74 Ill. 312.\\nIf at the time of the death of William H, Hutchings he had' owned or controlled a permanent home in Illinois, in which he resided, or to which he intended to return to live, if away from the same temporarily, then his home would have been the home or domicile of appellant, in the sense in which that term is issued in said section 74. In the case cited Hayes had a homestead in Rock Island, Illinois, which he rented with a part of his furniture and in which he stored the balance. This homestead he owned at the' time of his death. The court found that he was away from his home temporarily with the intention of returning to it, and with no intention of making a home elsewhere. In that case the court say: “In a strict legal sense, that is properly the domicile of a.person where he has his true, fixed permanent home and principal establishment and to which, whenever he is absent, he has the intention of returning.”\",\n",

Arthur Dixon Transfer Company, Appellee. The decision date is (1951-04-06)\\n\\nMr. Presiding Justice Schwartz\\ndelivered the opinion of the court.\\nThis is an action in which plaintiff seeks to recover from defendant moneys paid by plaintiff’s predecessors in interest (Alton Railroad Company and the Trustee thereof) in settlement of the claim of one Wehunt, a switchman. A motion to strike the second amended complaint was sustained and suit dismissed, from which order plaintiff appeals. Inasmuch as no point is made on the question of plaintiff’s succession, we will in this opinion call plaintiff and its predecessors the “railroad.”\\nOn July 11, 1942 Wehunt was participating in the switching movement of a boxcar at the Harrison Street Yard of the railroad in Chicago and was standing on a ladder attached to the southeast corner of the boxcar as the car was moving. Defendant, a trucking contractor, had an agreement to do certain trucking for the railroad and in the performance of its duties would enter the yard and park its motor trucks for the purpose of receiving and delivering freight. At the time of the switching movement referred to, defendant had parked one of its trucks so close to the rail that Wehunt was caught between the truck trailer and the boxcar and was injured. He made a claim under the Federal Employers ’ Liability Act for injuries received and the railroad settled with him by paying $15,000 in addition to other sums advanced. Before making settlement, the railroad gave proper notice to defendant.\\nDefendant’s motion to strike the second amended statement of claim alleged four grounds, the first two of which amount to a general demurrer, and it is on this that defendant relies. Plaintiff filed a motion to strike defendant’s motion to strike on the ground that under Section 45 motions to strike should specifically point out defects. Therefore, the only point of pleading involved is whether under the Practice Act as it now stands a motion to strike which is tantamount to a general demurrer is permissible.',\n",

Ann. 104.045] specifically provides that all objections to pleadings heretofore raised by demurrer shall be raised by motion and that the motion shall point out specifically the defects complained of; that where a pleading is objected to on the ground that it is substantially insufficient in law, the motion must specify wherein such pleading is insufficient. The courts have sustained this provision of the Act and interpreted it to mean what it so clearly states. Hitchcock v. Reynolds, 278 Ill. App. 559, 562; Messick v. Mohr, 292 Ill. App. 69; S. W.

Defendant argues, however, that failure to state a cause of action sufficient in law is not susceptible of such particularity. With this we cannot agree. In its brief, defendant has set forth that the complaint shows the railroad was a volunteer; that the railroad’s liability was not secondary within the meaning of the implied indemnity cases; that the railroad was guilty of active negligence; that defendant’s negligence did not proximately cause the injury; that Wehunt was guilty of contributory negligence, etc. These points could all have been set forth in its motion. That is what is required by the Act. Prior to the Practice Act demurrers had come to have an odious synonymity with deliberate delay. In fact, we had a rule in our trial courts that counsel had to file an affidavit with a general or special demurrer swearing that it was not interposed for delay. That rule fell into innocuous desuetude. It was ineffective to stop demurrers filed for delay. We should not revive that time-dishonored practice. We do not',\n",

The court there said: “If, with all intendments in its favor, a complaint wholly and absolutely fails to state any cause of action at all, objection can be made to it for the first time on appeal. But, on the other hand, if the complaint states a cause of action, no matter how defectively or imperfectly alleged, and the same is not challenged below, then such defectively stated cause of action is cured by verdict and cannot be questioned on appeal. ’ ’ When challenged by a motion to strike, however, the rule is that the averments of the pleader are taken against him.

Arthur Dixon Transfer Company, Appellee. The decision date is (1951-04-06)\\n\\nTwo cases sustaining a right of action on implied indemnity, where liability under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act was caused by the act of a third person, are Booth-Kelly Lumber Co. v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co., 183 F. (2d) 902; and United States v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific R. R. Co., 171 F. (2d) 377. The physical facts in both of those cases are almost identical with the instant case. In the Booth-Kelly case an indemnity agreement contained two provisions, one for full indemnity where the loss occurred solely by act of the defendant, and one for a division of the loss equally where it occurred through the con- . eurring negligence of both parties. While the suit was based on the contract of indemnity, the court considered it necessary to determine the state of the common law in order to arrive at a correct interpretation of the contract. They said in substance that in practically all cases the occasion for seeking indemnity would not arise unless the indemnitee were himself guilty of some fault. Therefore, if the court were to assume that the existence of any negligence, whether it be active or passive, threw the case within the provision for sharing indemnity, there would be no case in which the indemnitor would be liable for the full amount. The court concluded that the provision for full indemnity related to that group of cases where the railroad was guilty of only passive negligence and would therefore at common law have a right of action against the indemnitor for the full amount; that the provision for the sharing of indemnity applied to those cases where the parties were in pari delicto. Examining the facts under a common-law microscope the court held that while the railroad was negligent in a sense sufficient to create a liability under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act, that negligence was of a passive. character and the active negligence was that of defendant’s employee in placing the wood cart so near the track that the railroad’s',\n",

App. 330, is strongly in point. In that case a railroad employee was injured by a faulty sanding machine installed by defendant. This court through Mr. Justice McSurely stated the applicable principle in these words: “Where a person has been compelled to pay damages on account of the negligence of a third party, the person so paying damages when he is without fault or negligence on his part and the injury is solely the result of the negligence of the third party, may recover such damages from the third party.” The court went on to say that the declaration in that case, even though it alleged, as here, that plaintiff had been rendered liable to its employee because of its failure to provide a safe place to work, nevertheless contained the allegations necessary to make a case under that principle. The case was later tried on its merits and defendant was found not guilty. On appeal this court again reversed the judg-\\nment and this time speaking through Mr. Justice 0 ’Connor held that it was error for the trial court to instruct the jury that there was no contribution between joint tort-feasors, saying the parties were not in pari delicto and the rule which prevents contributions between joint tort-feasors did not apply.',\n",

Arthur Dixon Transfer Company, Appellee. The decision date is (1951-04-06)\\n\\nThe vast growth of negligence law has markedly changed the characteristics of negligence actions. Legal negligence no longer embodies a concept of misbehavior just short of the criminal or the immoral. The courts have, therefore, had to find a way to do justice within the law so that one guilty of an act of negligence — affirmative, active, primary in its character— will not escape scot-free, leaving another whose fault was only technical or passive to assume complete liability. In dealing with the question, the courts have had before them the problem stated in Booth-Kelly v. Southern Pacific, supra, that in practically all cases the indemnitee has himself been guilty of legal negligence. This led to some confusion in terms used. That the vocabulary of negligence law is not adequate for our day is apparent from the contemporary writings on the subject. Thus, in these decisions the courts say plaintiff (indemnitee) was without fault or that he was only technically negligent even though the liability was based on legal negligence. What is meant is that plaintiff by act of defendant was made liable for failing to discharge a responsibility even though he, plaintiff, was not guilty of any active negligence. In the instant case plaintiff has alleged in its complaint that it was not negligent and defendant says that if it were not negligent, then it was only a volunteer when it made payment to the injured switchman. From the facts set forth in the second amended complaint and the legal situation which confronted plaintiff we understand clearly that what it meant was that the railroad was guilty of only passive technical negligence and that the active and primary negligence was that of defendant in placing its truck where it was a danger to plaintiff’s employees. Examined in this light the second amended complaint states a case.',\n",

The decision date is (1951-04-06)\\n\\nDefendant has sought to distinguish the cases herein cited but while some distinction may always be made, we are of the opinion that the principle set forth amply covers the instant case. One case cited by defendant presents a state of facts which closely resembles the instant case, Wallace v. New Orleans Public Belt R. Co., 78 F. Supp. 724. This was an opinion by a federal trial court. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court on a jurisdictional ground. It is thus the opinion of a trial court which did not have jurisdiction of the case. Moreover, the opinion is not entirely clear as to the ground upon which it was made. The case of Detroit G. H. & M. Ry. Co. v. Boomer, 194 Mich. 52, cited by defendant has some similarity to the instant case. The court held that as the railroad was moving the train at the time of the accident it was actively negligent. We have already discussed the confusion arising in large part from the fact that the vocabulary of negligence law is wholly inadequate to meet its current complexities. Certainly the courts in the cases we have cited did not intend any such limited meaning for the phrase “passive or technical negligence.” In Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Roberts & Schaefer Co., 250 Ill. App. 330, the railroad was considered passively negligent although the railroad employee actively pulled a rope that brought down the weight on his fellow-employee. In United States v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., 171 F. (2d) 377, a pile of material was the obstruction and the engine was mov- ' ing, still the railroad was held to be only passively negligent. It is clear that mere motion does not define the distinction between active and passive negligence.\",\n",

The decision date is (1951-04-06)\\n\\nSome of the other cases cited by defendant are cases in which the action over was for workmen’s compensation paid by plaintiff to one of its employees. Here the authorities are in conflict. Those that have denied the right to an action over by the employer have done so on an understanding of workmen’s compensation which is best set forth in the case of Interstate Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Public Service Electric Co., 8 N. J. L. 26, 90 Atl. 1062 where it was said, “We cannot distinguish, in legal effect, this compensation agreed to be paid to the employee from the ordinary compensation called wages. ’ ’\\nThe oldest and most approved statement of the principle involved in this case is found in Lowell v. Boston & Lowell Railroad Corp., 23 Pick. (Mass.) 24, as follows: “In respect to offenses in which is involved any moral delinquency or turpitude all parties are deemed equally guilty, and the courts will not inquire into their relative guilt; but where the offense is merely malum prohibitum and is in no respect immoral, it is not against the policy of the law to inquire into the relative delinquency of the parties and to administer justice between them although both parties are wrongdoers.” This statement of the law has been approved by the Supreme Court of the United States and by the Supreme Court of Illinois, Washington Gas Light Co. v. District of Columbia, 161 U. S. 316, 327; Griffiths & Sons Company v. National Fireproofing Company, 310 Ill. 331, 338. The second amended complaint certainly states a case coming well within the broad outlines of this principle.\\nJudgment is reversed and the cause remanded with directions to overrule the motion of defendant to strike the second amended complaint, to require defendant to answer, and to hear the case on its merits.\\nJudgment reversed and cause remanded with directions.\\nFriend and Scanlan, JJ., concur.',\n",

The decision date is (1945-12-18)\\n\\nThe only ground or theory alleged in the amended complaint upon which plaintiffs predicated their right to the relief sought was that when Beeby executed and delivered the quitclaim deed to defendant on June 29, 1933, he and defendant “then and there orally agreed that the same would be additional security for the mortgage indebtedness . . . held and \"owned by said Christine J.

It is asserted in plaintiffs’ brief that the above quoted allegation avers “the ultimate fact that the deed was intended as additional security, and the evidence supported this allegation.” In our opinion this is not a correct statement of the substance and meaning of this averment. The ultimate fact set forth therein was that the parties “ orally agreed” that the quitclaim deed would be additional security for the mortgage indebtedness and the proof required to support, this allegation was that Beeby and defendant did enter into an oral agreement that manifested their intention that the quitclaim deed was given merely as additional security for the mortgage indebtedness. Not only is there no evidence in the record to show that Beeby and the defendant entered into the alleged oral agreement but plaintiffs made no attempt to prove any such agreement. Inasmuch as the only cause of action alleged in plaintiffs ’ amended complaint was that when Beeby executed and delivered the quitclaim deed to defendant, he at the same time “orally agreed” with her that said deed would be merely additional security for the mortgage indebtedness and since plaintiffs made no attempt to prove this cause of action, the trial court, instead of finding in its decree that “the allegations of the amended complaint are true as therein stated,” should have sustained defendant’s exceptions to the master’s report and found that plaintiffs had failed to prove the aforesaid oral',\n",

(Leitch v. Sanitary Dist. of Chicago, 386 Ill. 433.)

Defendant denied that she told Luella Jane Beehy that “the rent was to apply on the mortgagé, to get the mortgage off.” Defendant admitted in her testimony that, when Beehy delivered the quitclaim deed to her she retained in her possession the principal mortgage note, the trust deed and the extension agreement, instead of cancelling same and turning them over to him. Plaintiffs also introduced evidence by which they attempted to show that the consideration received by Beehy for his quitclaim deed was grossly inadequate.\\nIt certainly cannot be held that the flimsy, uncorroborated testimony of Luella Jane Beehy that Mrs. Botsford told her that “the rent was to apply on the mortgage” constituted the clear, satisfactory and convincing proof required to show that a deed absolute was intended to be merely additional security for a mortgage indebtedness.',\n",

The decision date is (1945-12-18)\\n\\nIt is true that under the particular circumstances of some cases there is a presumption that “where the grantor is indebted to the grantee at the time of the conveyance and the note evidencing such indebtedness is retained by the grantee, such indebtedness was not satisfied by the conveyance, and, until the contrary is shown, the presumption is that the instrument, though a deed absolute on its face, is a mortgage.” Wallace v. Greenman, 321 Ill. 423, 430. However, a different situation arises where, as here, the defendant testified positively that her note and mortgage were paid by the quitclaim deed and that she thereafter paid all general taxes levied against the property and expended considerable money in keeping same in repair. In addition defendant made no demand upon Beehy during his lifetime or upon his daughter after his death for payment of principal or interest on the mortgage.\\nIn Kimmel v. Bundy, 302 Ill. 514, under a comparable factual situation the court said at p. 517:\\n“It is contended that appellee retained possession of the notes and mortgage of appellant which he held when the deed was made, and that circumstances shows the debt was not satisfied by the conveyance. The notes and mortgage were not delivered to appellant when he made the deed. He testified appellee promised to send them by mail but did not do so, and appears never to have made any demand or request for them. It is difficult to understand why appellee promised to send them to him if they represented an existing indebtedness. In addition to that, appellee testified positively they were paid by the conveyance, and so far as the evidence shows their payment was never afterwards mentioned by either of the parties. The proof shows the consideration paid was the full value of the land at the time.”',\n",

The decision date is (1945-12-18)\\n\\nWe have carefully examined all the evidence in the record bearing on the adequacy of the consideration which Beeby received for the quitclaim deed but it would serve no purpose to discuss same except to further lengthen this already long opinion. There can be no question but that Beeby’s mortgage indebtedness was satisfied by his quitclaim deed and that defendant assumed the burden of satisfying the numerous liens against the property for general taxes and special assessments. We think that the proof shows that the consideration paid was the full value of the property at the time the quitclaim deed was delivered and that the conclusion reached by the master that the consideration received by Beeby was grossly inadequate was against the manifest weight of the evidence. It is a matter of common knowledge that when this property was conveyed by Beeby to defendant in 1933, many property owners, who were in default as to mortgages and taxes and had no means of paying same, quitclaimed their property in satisfaction of the mortgage debt and for an additional nominal consideration in order to avoid the possibility of having deficiency judgments entered against them in foreclosure proceedings.\\nWe are impelled to hold that there is no merit in Luella Jane Beeby’s claim of interest in the property involved herein and that the trial court erred in entering the decree in plaintiffs’ favor.\\nAs an additional reason for reversal defendant contends that plaintiffs were guilty of laches.

Botsford et al. Appeal of Christine J. Botsford, Appellant. The decision date is (1945-12-18)\\n\\nBeeby delivered the quitclaim deed to defendant on June 29, 1933. He died April 20, 1934 without making any claim up to the time of his death that said deed was merely given as additional security for his mortgage indebtedness to defendant. As heretofore shown, the real estate involved herein was registered under the Torrens system, and plaintiff, Luella Jane Beeby, filed an affidavit prepared by Attorney Hillstrom claiming an interest in the property. This affidavit was dated April 30, 1934 and registered in the Office of the Registrar of Titles May 11, 1934. Hillstrom was named as executor in Beeby’s will. He filed the will in the probate court clerk’s office on May 4, 1934 but he failed and refused to probate same. He renounced his appointment as executor on May 4,1941, at which time plaintiff, Edward C. Steinhauer, was appointed administrator with the will annexed. This suit was filed July 30, 1941 and prior to its institution, which was more than eight years after the delivery of the quitclaim deed and more than seven years after Beeby’s death, Luella Jane Beeby made no demand on defendant for an accounting nor did she make any inquiry concerning the real estate at any time before this action was brought. Upon the delivery of the quitclaim deed deféhdant took possession and control of the real estate and thereafter collected the rents, paid taxes and made repairs. The only person present at the time the quitclaim deed was delivered other than Beeby and the defendant was one Martin Johnson, a notary public, who acknowledged Beeby’s signature to the deed. Johnson could not be located at the time of the hearing and he had not been heard from for about four years prior thereto. When the quitclaim deed was delivered to defendant on June 29, 1933, real estate values were low because of the depression and when this suit was filed, more than eight years later, there had been an appreciable increase in the value of the real estate involved herein.',\n",

Hillstrom, the executor named in the will of James A.

Under the law Hillstrom could have been removed as executor as far back as 1934, because of his refusal to act as such. Hillstrom was a lawyer as well as a real estate broker. He prepared Luella Jane Beeby’s claim of interest in the real estate in question and was fully acquainted therewith.

Poulsen, 321 Ill. 480, where the court said at p. 483:\\n“Good faith and reasonable diligence of parties seeking the relief of a court of equity are the elements that call it into activity. In the absence of these elements the court remains passive and declines to extend its aid. It has always been the policy of equity to discountenance bad faith and neglect. A party who challenges the title of his adversary to real property must be diligent in discovering that which will avoid the title or render it invalid and diligent in his application for relief. (Booker v. Booker, 208 Ill. 529; Fitch v. Miller, 200 id. 170; Walker v. Warner, 179 id. 16.) Appellants have shown no circumstances which excuse their delay in asserting their claim to these premises, and for this additional reason appellants are not entitled to the relief asked in the cross-bill.”\",\n",

Days before Cain’s scheduled release date, the State filed a petition to detain Cain under the Act. Cain subsequently was found by a jury to be a sexually violent person and was committed to the Department of Human Services. This judgment was upheld on direct appeal. In re Detention of Cain, No. 5 — 99—0197 (March 30, 2000) (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23 (166 Ill. 2d R. 23)). In April 2000, Cain filed his first petition for conditional release under section 60 of the Act (725 ILCS 207/60 (West 2000)). Initially, the circuit court found that probable cause existed to believe that it was not substantially probable that Cain would engage in acts of sexual violence if released, and the court ordered a full hearing. At the full hearing, however, the court determined that the State had proved by clear and convincing evidence that Cain was still a sexually violent person and should not be released. Cain appealed this ruling, which ultimately was consolidated with his appeal from the finding that no probable cause existed to warrant a full hearing to determine whether he still was a sexually violent person after his 18-month evaluation.

The court again found that probable cause did not exist to warrant a full hearing to determine whether Cain was still a sexually violent person. The court also denied Cain’s request for the appointment of an independent expert. Cain appealed these adverse rulings and further complained that he had been denied due process because he had not been present for the hearing. The same day, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in Crane. Under Crane, the permissible civil commitment of a person as sexually violent requires a finding that the individual has “serious difficulty in controlling [his or her] behavior.” Crane, 534 U.S. at 413, 151 L. Ed. 2d at 862, 122 S. Ct. at 870. Cain filed a motion for his immediate release from custody, based on Crane. The court denied Cain’s motion.

Cain also finds fault with the court’s refusal to appoint an independent expert for his 30-month evaluation when the State was allowed to have an expert. Cain further argues that due process required his presence at the probable cause hearing. For his final point on appeal, Cain asserts that the State failed to show “proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior” as mandated by Crane, 534 U.S. at 413, 151 L. Ed. 2d at 862, 122 S.

The decision date is (2003-06-18)\\n\\nAt the probable cause hearing, the State offered the 30-month psychological reexamination report submitted by Dr. Phil Reidda. The reexamination consisted of a review of Cain’s treatment progress, psychological testing, a clinical interview, and risk analysis. Dr. Reidda, consistently with his previous evaluations, diagnosed Cain with pedophilia toward males and females and a personality disorder with antisocial traits. He further noted that Cain remained exceedingly resistive to clinical treatment and instead focused his efforts primarily on legal issues. According to Dr. Reidda, the risk analysis also demonstrated that Cain has a substantial and continuing risk of reoffending. He therefore opined that Cain was still a sexually violent person in need of clinical treatment in a secure facility. Based on Dr. Reidda’s report alone, the court properly found that probable cause did not exist to conclude that Cain was no longer a sexually violent person entitled to a discharge. The court, however, did not rely solely on this report; it also reviewed prior reexamination reports to measure Cain’s treatment progress. We agree that each report represents an individual part of a person’s treatment history, which must be considered as a whole. We therefore conclude that the court properly considered past reports. We also find no fault with the court’s decision not to appoint another expert. The court specifically noted that appointing Cain’s expert at that point would have been of no assistance to the court, given that there had been absolutely no change in Cain’s condition and he had been resistant to sex offender treatment. In the court’s own words, “[The expert], you know, can’t say that facts are happening that aren’t happening.” While the Act allows for the appointment of an expert for an indigent person, it certainly does not require a court to take such action.

The use of the term “may” in section 55(a) reveals a clear intent by the legislature to provide courts with the discretion to appoint such an expert.

The decision date is (2003-06-18)\\n\\nWe likewise conclude that procedural due process does not entitle a committed person to attend the probable cause hearing for a postcommitment reexamination, as Cain contends. Section 65(b)(1) clearly states, “The committed person has a right to have an attorney represent him or her at the probable cause hearing, but the person is not entitled to be present at the probable cause hearing.” 725 ILCS 207/65(b)(l) (West 2000). Section 65(b)(1) adequately protects a person’s liberty interest by explicitly providing the committed person with the right to have an attorney represent him at the probable cause hearing. Civil commitment is nonpunitive and lasts only so long as is necessary to address an individual’s problems. “Because this is a lesser intrusion on the liberty of the [individual] than a criminal conviction, it triggers lesser procedural due process rights.” In re Perona, 294 Ill. App. 3d 755, 765, 690 N.E.2d 1058, 1065 (1998). Our conclusion is supported by the fact that Cain’s presence at the hearing would have added no value to the proceedings. The probable cause hearing consists only of a review of the reexamination reports and arguments on behalf of the parties. 725 ILCS 207/65(b)(l) (West 2000). The committed person has sufficient opportunity to consult with counsel about the reexamination report prior to the hearing, and any possible false statements made at the hearing can be corrected by counsel, who certainly would be familiar with the contents of the report. We believe that the concerns raised in Botruff, and relied upon by Cain in making his argument, are unsubstantiated. We therefore decline to follow Botruff. We further note that the Act contains numerous other postcommitment procedural safeguards against the erroneous deprivation of a person’s liberty interest. We therefore conclude that Cain was not deprived of any procedural due process in this instance and that the court did not err in conducting the probable cause hearing in Cain’s absence.',\n",

The decision date is (2003-06-18)\\n\\nFor his final point on appeal, Cain argues the court erred in denying his petition for his immediate release under the reasoning of Crane. Specifically, Cain contends that the State has yet to provide proof of a serious difficulty in controlling his behavior. Several cases have determined that the Act satisfies the requirements of due process and that the Act’s definition of mental disorder sufficiently narrows the class of individuals eligible for commitment to those who are unable to control their dangerousness. Due process therefore does not require a jury to make an additional finding that a person lacks the capacity to control his sexually violent behavior. See, e.g., People v. Swanson, 335 Ill. App. 3d 117, 123, 780 N.E.2d 342, 347 (2002), appeal denied, 206 Ill. 2d 641 (2003); People v. Kastman, 335 Ill. App. 3d 87, 101-02, 779 N.E.2d 333, 345 (2002); In re Detention of Isbell, 333 Ill. App. 3d 906, 912-13, 777 N.E.2d 994, 999 (2002); People v. Hancock, 329 Ill. App. 3d 367, 375, 771 N.E.2d 459, 465 (2002). These cases primarily relied upon the Illinois Supreme Court’s opinion in In re Detention of Varner, 198 Ill. 2d 78, 84-86, 759 N.E.2d 560, 563-64 (2001). In re Detention of Varner, however, is no longer settled law, in that the United States Supreme Court vacated the Illinois Supreme Court’s judgment and remanded the cause for further consideration in light of Crane. Varner v. Illinois, 537 U.S. 802, 154 L. Ed. 2d 3, 123 S. Ct. 69 (2002) (mem.); see also In re Detention of Traynoff, 338 Ill. App. 3d 949 (2003). We believe, however, that Cain’s commitment as a sexually violent person necessarily involved “proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior” consistent with Crane, 534 U.S. at 413, 151 L. Ed. 2d at 862, 122 S. Ct. at 870. See Swanson, 335 Ill. App. 3d at 123, 780 N.E.2d at 347; In re Detention of Isbell, 333 Ill. App. 3d at 912-13, 777 N.E.2d at 999.

In order to commit a person, the State must first prove that the individual suffers from a mental disorder that affects his or her ability to control his or her conduct. See 725 ILCS 207/5(b) (West 2000). And to find the individual sexually dangerous under the Act, the trier of fact must find that the State proved that the person is dangerous because he or she suffers from a mental disorder that makes it substantially probable that he or she will engage in further acts of sexual violence. See 725 ILCS 207/5(f) (West 2000). There is therefore no need for the trier of fact to make additional findings regarding that individual’s ability to control his or her conduct. See Swanson, 335 Ill. App. 3d at 123, 780 N.E.2d at 347. The same can be said for his post-commitment proceedings. The State had the burden of proving under section 65 of the Act, by clear and convincing evidence, that Cain was still a sexually violent person, which necessarily involved “proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior” by definition. Accordingly, the court correctly denied Cain’s petition for his immediate release. We find no error.',\n",

Zanders harassed her after she opposed unlawful discrimination (Disandro’s alleged sexual harassment), thereby raising an inference of retaliatory motivation.\\nCount III alleged unequal terms and conditions of employment, during the same time period contained in counts I and II, due to her sex, female. She alleged that Lt. Zanders continually gave her less desirable assignments and on several occasions had denied her holiday and compensatory time pay, although it had been previously approved and/or she had documentation to justify it, forcing her to submit additional information and documents before the situation was corrected.',\n",

The decision date is (2006-10-20)\\n\\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\\nThe decision of the chief legal counsel to sustain dismissal of a charge should be upheld unless the decision was “arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.” Gusciara v. Lustig, 346 Ill. App. 3d 1012, 1017, 806 N.E.2d 746, 750 (2004). Agency action is arbitrary and capricious when the agency contravenes the legislature’s intent, fails to consider a crucial aspect of the problem, or offers an implausible explanation contrary to agency expertise. Allen v. Lieberman, 359 Ill. App. 3d 1170, 1177, 836 N.E.2d 64, 69 (2005). Substantial evidence is defined as “evidence which a reasonable mind accepts as sufficient to support a particular conclusion and which consists of more than a mere scintilla but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.” 775 ILCS 5/7A — 102(D)(2) (West 2004); see Stone v. Department of Human Rights, 299 Ill. App. 3d 306, 314, 700 N.E.2d 1105, 1111 (1998). Substantial evidence has also been said to be “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.” Stone, 299 Ill. App. 3d at 315, 700 N.E.2d at 1111. For the following reasons, we affirm the chief legal counsel’s decision to sustain the Department’s dismissal of counts I, III, and V which were based on sex discrimination. However, we conclude that the chief legal counsel abused his discretion in finding a lack of substantial evidence regarding petitioner’s claims of retaliation based upon her opposing unlawful discrimination, namely, Disandro’s alleged sexual harassment.\\nANALYSIS\\nPetitioner’s claims, although somewhat intertwined, include charges of discrimination based on her sex (i.e., her gender-based status), as well as charges of retaliation based on her opposition to Disandro’s alleged sexual harassment (i.e., her conduct). We shall first address petitioner’s sex discrimination charges.\\nSex Discrimination Claim',\n",

(1982)). Zaderaka v. Illinois Human Rights Comm’n, 131 Ill. 2d 172, 178, 545 N.E.2d 684, 687 (1989). A person can establish discrimination through either the direct method that an adverse employment action was taken for unlawful discriminatory reasons or through the indirect method pursuant to McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668, 93 S. Ct. 1817 (1973), adopted by the Illinois Supreme Court in Zaderaka, 131 Ill. 2d at 178-79, 545 N.E.2d at 687.\\nTo establish a prima facie case of discrimination in accordance with the analysis set out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668, 93 S. Ct. 1817 (1973), a complainant must demonstrate that (1) she engaged in a protected activity that was known by the respondent; (2) the respondent subsequently took some adverse action against the complainant; and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the disadvantageous employment action. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668, 93 S. Ct. 1817 (1973). Because petitioner failed to show that the City committed a material adverse act against her, she failed to sufficiently demonstrate the second element and, thus, failed to establish a prima facie case of sex discrimination.',\n",

[Citations.]” Washington v. Rlinois Department of Revenue, 420 F.3d 658, 661 (7th Cir. 2005). As the court in Traylor explained, an adverse employment action had been defined by that court as “ ‘more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.

We conclude that petitioner did not suffer a materially adverse employment action sufficient to support her charges of discrimination based on sex. Counts I, III and V allege that petitioner was harassed, subjected to unequal terms and conditions of employment, and given an inaccurate performance evaluation, and that all of these actions were based upon her sex. Those allegations, taken as true, do not establish a severe or pervasive change in the daily conditions of employment. Thus, the chief legal counsel did not abuse his discretion in finding a lack of substantial evidence to support petitioner’s charges of discrimination based on sex.

The decision date is (2006-10-20)\\n\\nIn determining whether an employer’s alleged retaliation constituted an actionable adverse act, the Illinois Human Rights Commission has considered analogous federal cases arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. §2000e et seq. (1982)). See, e.g., In re Papa, Ill. Hum. Rts. Comm’n Rep. 1997SF0146 (June 9, 2000). The United States Supreme Court had noted, with respect to Title VII’s antidiscrimination provision requirements, that a broad array of actions may constitute an adverse employment action including such employer acts as “hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.” Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 761, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633, 652-53, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 2268 (1998). More recently, however, the United States Supreme Court discussed the degree of material adversity that must be alleged in a Title VII retaliation claim. Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345, 126 S. Ct. 2405 (2006). As the White court noted, Ellerth did not even mention Title VII’s antiretaliation provision White, 548 U.S. at 65, 165 L. Ed. 2d at 357-58, 126 S. Ct. at 2413), and declined to extend Elleth’s holding. The White Court distinguished Title VII’s antidiscrimination provision from its antiretaliation provision. See also Washington v. Illinois Department of Revenue, 420 F.3d 658, 660 (7th Cir. 2005) (noting that “[Title VII’s antiretaliation provision] is ‘broader’ than [its antidiscrimination provision] in the sense that retaliation may take so many forms, while [the antidiscrimination provision] is limited to discrimination ‘with respect to [the worker’s] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment’ ”).',\n",

Ed. 2d at 359, 126 S. Ct. at 2414. The White opinion then characterized “how harmful an act of retaliatory discrimination must be in order to fall within [Title VU’s antiretaliation] provision’s scope.” White, 548 U.S. at 61, 165 L.

White, 548 U.S. at 68, 165 L. Ed. 2d at 359, 126 S. Ct. at 2415. The Court referred to a reasonable employee’s reactions because the provision’s standard for judging harm must be an objective standard. White, 548 U.S. at 68, 165 L. Ed. 2d at 360, 126 S. Ct. at 2415. An objective standard was noted to be judicially administrable in that “[i]t avoids the uncertainties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to determine a plaintiff’s unusual subjective feelings.” White, 548 U.S. at 68-69, 165 L. Ed. 2d at 360, 126 S. Ct. at 2415.\\nAs noted, this was the standard previously applied by the Seventh Circuit in Washington. The Washington court, noting that a change in hours normally would not be material, decided that where an employee had sought and been approved for flextime in order to care for her son who had Down’s syndrome, the removal of her flextime schedule, by way of abolishing her position and requiring her to start a newly created position, could potentially constitute a material change to her working conditions that was actionable under the antiretaliation provision of Title VII. Washington, 420 F.3d at 662. See also Balderrama v. Kraft Foods North America, Inc., 307 F. Supp. 2d 1012, 1014 (N.D. Ill. 2004) (in the retaliation setting, the standard for determining whether an employer’s act constitutes an adverse employment action has been determined to be less demanding).\\nWith respect to the materiality requirement, the Washington court opined that potentially “an act that would be immaterial in some situations is material in others.” Washington, 420 F.3d at 661.

This assignment was even acknowledged by three witnesses, i.e., three other officers, to be “a punishment post.” There was evidence from Officers Weidel, Velasquez and Dancy. All three attested to the fact that those post assignments, which consist exclusively of sitting at an entrance gate and “swiping in” vehicles, as opposed to patrol duties throughout the airport grounds, are commonly known by officers as punishment assignments. Respondents downplay the significance of petitioner’s claim that she was assigned to posts 1 and 2 — posts described by three witnesses as “punishment posts” — more often than men and more often than anyone who did not complain about sexual harassment.\\nRespondents are incorrect about the significance of Lt. Zanders’ assignment decisions, in the retaliation setting. As the Commission has explained:\\n“In every workplace there are job duties which are considered undesirable. If an employer, with impunity, could assign employees who protest unlawful discrimination to undesirable tasks, very few individuals would protest against unlawful discrimination. Just as some people might prefer to work the overnight shift, it is likely that a few sergeants would prefer to work behind a desk instead of on patrol. Nevertheless, where assignments are generally seen as undesirable, the employer should not be able to use the fact that a few people might enjoy the assignment to avoid liability for having retaliated against an employee.” In re Papa, Ill.

She has established the first element, namely, that she was engaged in a protected activity. It was uncontested that petitioner filed an internal complaint about Disandro’s harassment in August 2002 with Lt. LeRoy Pestka and Juan Rodriguez, personnel department officer.',\n",

In the hearing before the Department, it was uncontested that Lt. Zanders was aware of petitioner’s complaint against Disandro. As noted earlier, when Disandro was suspended in August 2002 for violating the City’s residency requirement, he became furious with petitioner because he suspected that she had “dropped a dime” on him. He allegedly threatened that he “knew people from the old neighborhood” and that he could have her “dropped,” and that he knew people who were getting released from prison soon. It was uncontested during the Department’s hearing that, during this time, petitioner indicated that Disandro retaliated against her for opposing his sexual advances and she was advised to file a police report against Disandro and to file a formal complaint with the City’s sexual harassment office. The Department found that it was uncontested that, in September 2002, Disandro was terminated from his employment. Petitioner disputes this fact and asserts that Disandro remained on administrative leave and that he continued to show up at the workplace and was assisted by Lt. Zanders in gaining unauthorized access to the restricted area of the workplace. Petitioner contends that Lt. Zanders openly expressed his hostility toward her based upon his comments in reaction to her complaints about Disandro’s conduct, bluntly telling her, “I do not care what you’ve got.” In addition to these acts, Lt. Zanders allegedly engaged in all of the other acts in petitioner’s charge that constituted the material adverse employment actions, in retaliation for her opposing the harassment by Disandro.',\n",

The decision date is (2006-10-20)\\n\\nMoreover, temporal proximity between a protected activity and an adverse action has been considered. A prima facie case of retaliatory discharge can be established by showing a short time span between the filing of a discrimination charge and the employer’s adverse action. See, e.g., Maye v. Human Rights Comm’n, 224 Ill. App. 3d 353, 362, 586 N.E.2d 550, 556 (1991) (and cases cited therein). Because petitioner established a prima facie case of retaliation, she created a rebuttable presumption of unlawful retaliation by the City. Petitioner, however, contends that, in making the threshold determination of a lack of evidence, the Department strayed radically from its proper role within the Illinois statutory scheme under the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/1 — 101 et seq. (West 2002)) and functioned more like an adjudicative body than an investigative body. We conclude that the chief legal counsel’s decision to uphold the Department’s dismissal of counts II, I\\\\( and VI must be reversed and this cause remanded for further investigation.\\nBecause we are remanding this matter, it is important to note that we disagree with respondents’ position that the Department correctly refused to consider Disandro’s alleged sexual harassment of petitioner because her “charge” did not allege sexual harassment and that, therefore, this court has no jurisdiction to consider the acts of sexual harassment committed by Disandro. We agree with petitioner that pursuant to the Morgan doctrine, the entire pattern of harassment should have been considered. See National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106, 122 S. Ct. 2061 (2002). Petitioner’s complaint clearly alleged that Lt. Zanders’ harassment was in retaliation for her prior opposition to the alleged sexual harassment by Disandro.',\n",

Zanders’ openly announced sexual bias based upon his comments that women are “bottom feeders,” “inept,” and “incompetent,” and his view that women, as a class, cannot write police reports as well as men, as a class. As noted earlier, petitioner further contends that Lt. Zanders openly expressed his hostility toward her based upon his comments in reaction to her complaints about Disandro’s conduct, bluntly telling her “I do not care what you’ve got.”\\nIn Morgan, the Court explained that a “hostile work environment” results from the “cumulative effect of individual acts.” Morgan, 536 U.S. at 115, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 123, 122 S. Ct. at 2073. Thus, these acts “collectively constitute one ‘unlawful employment practice.’ ” Morgan, 536 U.S. at 117, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 125, 122 S. Ct. at 2075, quoting 42 U.S.C. §2000e — 5(e)(1) (1994). The Morgan Court held that even acts that occurred outside the statute of limitations period could be considered. Morgan, 536 U.S. at 117, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 125, 122 S. Ct. at 2075.\\nAlthough the Morgan case involved a statute of limitations defense, the reasoning applies here. All of the incidents comprising a hostile work environment are part of one unlawful employment practice, and the City may be liable for all acts that are part of this single claim. As this court recognized in Gusciara v. Lustig, 346 Ill. App. 3d 1012, 806 N.E.2d 746 (2004), however, the Morgan Court qualified its holding by “specifying that an act that occurs within the prescribed period will not enable an employee to recover for acts occurring outside the period if the later act ‘had no relation to the [earlier] acts’ or if, ‘for some other reason, such as certain intervening action\\n3\\nby the employer/ the more recent act was ‘no longer part of the same hostile environment claim/ ” Gusciara v. Lustig, 346 Ill. App. 3d at 1019, 806 N.E.2d at 751, quoting Morgan, 536 U.S. at 118, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 125, 122 S. Ct. at 2075.',\n",

In counts II, IV and VI of her six-count discrimination charge, petitioner alleged that the harassing conduct of Lt. Zanders was in retaliation for her opposition to unlawful discrimination by complaining to Lt. Zanders and others at the City about Disandro’s sexual harassment; sexual harassment which petitioner further alleged was condoned by Lt. Zanders. Thus, similar to Morgan and Gusciara, the instant case involves one unlawful employment practice and Lt. Zanders’ actions, if proved, constitute a part of the same hostile work environment as the alleged prior sexual harassment allegations against Disandro, as well as Disandro’s alleged threatening conduct since his return, all of which arguably result in an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment (see 775 ILCS 5/2 — 101(E) (West 2004)).\\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the chief legal counsel’s decision affirming the Department’s dismissal of petitioner’s charges of sex discrimination in counts I, III, and V We conclude, however, that there was substantial evidence presented of retaliation against petitioner for opposing Disandro’s sexual harassment. Thus, the chief legal counsel abused his discretion in upholding the Department’s dismissal of counts II, IV( and VI and those counts are reinstated.

The circuit court sentenced defendant to concurrent eight- and three-year terms of imprisonment, respectively. Defendant, represented by retained counsel, filed a notice of appeal. Nevertheless, on August 31, 1994, this court dismissed the appeal when counsel failed to file a brief and failed to respond to a rule to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for that reason. People v. Brandon, No. 4—94—0058 (August 31, 1994) (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23).\\nThe proceedings in the instant case began on November 30, 1994, when defendant’s retained counsel, the one who failed to file a brief on the direct appeal, filed a postconviction petition in the circuit court charging a discovery violation by the State. On June 16, 1995, the circuit clerk sent defendant a letter, in response to a letter from defendant that the clerk had purportedly received the day before, explaining that the appeal had been dismissed on August 31, 1994. On June 27, 1995, defendant filed a pro se postconviction petition in the circuit court alleging a denial of his right to effective assistance of counsel in both the circuit and appellate courts. On April 25, 1996, the public defender filed an amended postconviction petition asserting defendant was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel when his appeal was dismissed for failure of his counsel to file a brief.',\n",

The decision date is (1998-03-02)\\n\\nThe circuit court held a hearing on the public defender’s postconviction petition and entered an order on May 28, 1996. The order recited the case history we have set forth and found defendant was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel on appeal when counsel failed to file a brief. The court concluded that the best way to proceed was to direct the public defender to request this court to proceed with the original appeal. The circuit court then directed that it be done, and if this court did not allow the request, the “matter should be returned to [the circuit court] for further consideration.” Coincidentally, defendant’s retained attorney was disbarred by the Supreme Court of Illinois on the same day this order was entered.\\nA request to this court to reinstate the appeal was then made by motion filed under the original appeal docket number on September 27, 1996, slightly more than two years after the appeal was dismissed. This court denied that request on October 7, 1996, and the case was returned to the circuit court. On November 18, 1996, defendant moved for the circuit court either to acquit him or, in the alternative, grant him a new trial. After a hearing, the circuit court entered an order January 13, 1997, denying all the requested relief. The court noted that no showing had been made of the denial of any constitutional right in the circuit court and the circuit court was not responsible for the dismissal of the appeal. Defendant has filed a timely notice of appeal from that order.\\nDefendant relies upon the supreme court’s decision in People v. Moore, 133 Ill. 2d 331, 549 N.E.2d 1257 (1990), for his claim that he is entitled to direct appellate review of his conviction even though his prior appeal has been dismissed. We agree.',\n",

The decision date is (1998-03-02)\\n\\nIn Moore, a defendant’s appeal was dismissed in July 1980 by the appellate court for want of prosecution. In September 1983, disciplinary proceedings were instituted against defendant’s attorney which culminated in his suspension from the practice of law, due in part to his neglect of defendant’s appeal. Following the attorney’s suspension, defendant filed a motion to reinstate the appeal with the appellate court, which was denied on September 27, 1988. The opinion does not indicate when the motion to reinstate was filed, but the filing was necessarily several years after the appeal was dismissed.\\nThe supreme court granted defendant’s petition for leave to appeal from the appellate court order denying the motion to reinstate. The record indicated that defendant, acting pro se, had corresponded with the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts, which referred the matter to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission (ARDC). The supreme court concluded that defendant was an uneducated person and, despite correspondence with ARDC, did not likely understand his appeal had been dismissed until he contacted a new attorney and was so advised in July 1988.\\nIn Moore, the State contended that defendant’s remedy was the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 38, par. 122 — 1 et seq.), but the supreme court concluded that was not the only avenue of relief available to defendant and that the matter was properly before the supreme court. Citing Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 83 L. Ed. 2d 821, 105 S. Ct. 830 (1985), the opinion concluded that a defendant in a criminal case cannot be penalized for failure of his counsel to follow the required rules for appeals.

The case of Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75, 86-88, 102 L. Ed. 2d 300, 312-14, 109 S.

Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), cannot be used by the State to bar a grant of relief to a defendant.\\nFollowing its analysis, the supreme court exercised its supervisory authority. After finding “no reason to waste the time and resources of an already overburdened circuit court by requiring yet another circuit judge to rule on matters pertaining to defendant’s trial, only to have the matter ultimately return to the appellate court on appeal from the circuit court’s post-conviction ruling,” it directed that defendant’s appeal be reinstated in the appellate court.

The State maintains, however, this court has been without jurisdiction to proceed since 21 days after August 31, 1994, because the court lost jurisdiction of the matter when no petition for rehearing was filed within that period as required by Supreme Court Rule 367 (155 Ill. 2d R. 367), made applicable to criminal appeals by Supreme Court Rule 612(p) (134 Ill. 2d R. 612(p)). See Woodson v. Chicago Board of Education, 154 Ill. 2d 391, 397, 609 N.E.2d 318, 320-21 (1993). The State recognizes that, in Moore, more than 21 days elapsed between the dismissal of the appeal by the appellate court and the defendant’s request to reinstate the appeal. The State maintains, however, the supreme court could still order the appeal reinstated through the use of its supervisory authority, which this court does not possess. While that fact is undoubtedly true, although we note defendant did not seek leave to appeal from our order denying his motion to reinstate as was done in Moore, we need not resolve the issue of whether we may unilaterally reinstate defendant’s 1994 appeal. We have jurisdiction from the order denying postconviction relief on the current appeal. Indisputably, the question of a denial of the defendant’s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel on review was before the circuit court and we have jurisdiction to pass on the circuit court’s ruling thereon.',\n",

The parties agree that the trial court properly found defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel when his appeal was dismissed due to defense counsel’s failure to file an appellate brief. Given the supreme court’s admonition in Moore that “a post-conviction proceeding can, and should, be utilized in certain circumstances as a remedy for a lost right of appeal” (Moore, 133 Ill. 2d at 339, 549 N.E.2d at 1261), we conclude determination as to the nature of relief to be granted is not easy. We understand the frustration of the circuit court in trying to fashion the relief to be granted. One possible method might have been to order us to reinstate the appeal. That would have required a lower court to direct a higher court to take certain action. We have been unable to find any precedent for such procedure, and we can understand why the circuit court would have been reluctant to try such a procedure. In any event, no such drastic procedure is necessary here.\\nThe circuit court’s direction to defense counsel to ask this court to reinstate the appeal was borne of the lack of certainty as to the procedure to be followed. We now decide that, rather than having defense counsel ask this court to reinstate the appeal, the circuit court should have directed that a new notice of appeal be filed in that court from the original judgment in the criminal case.',\n",

The decree pro confesso against him can affect no one else, because it is not alleged in the bill, that, in any view, he has a present interest in the property that can be affected by the decree.

On appeal, defendant contends that: (1) the trial court erred in allowing the prior inconsistent statement of his brother to be introduced as substantive evidence; (2) the trial court erred in allowing a police officer to testify as to defendant’s unrelated arrest and his involvement in gang activity; (3) the trial court erred in denying defendant’s motion in limine to bar questions as to his gang affiliation; (4) the trial court erred in denying defendant’s request for production of the mugshot books viewed by the State’s eyewitness; (5) the trial court erred in denying defendant’s motion to suppress identification and in not allowing defense counsel an opportunity to cross-examine the police officer regarding the description he used in putting together the lineup at which defendant was identified; and (6) the State failed to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. For the following reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.',\n",

The decision date is (1991-09-23)\\n\\nThe record sets forth the following facts relevant to this appeal. Prior to trial, defendant moved to suppress identification testimony on the ground that the lineup in which the State’s key witness, Marvin Marshall, identified defendant had been improperly conducted. At the suppression hearing, Detective Dalponte of the Chicago police department testified that on July 12, 1988, he and his partner, Detective Gene Harris, conducted a lineup at police headquarters. Dalponte picked up Marshall from his home and drove him to police headquarters to view the lineup. No suggestions were made to Marshall as to whom he should pick out from the lineup. In selecting participants for the lineup, Dalponte picked the only four African-American males that were in the lockup at the time and put them and defendant in the lineup room. Dalponte asked each man to step up to the glass, face left, face right, then step back in line. Upon viewing a photo of the lineup at the hearing, Dalponte identified defendant as the first person on the right. Dalponte also stated that defendant had picked that position himself.\\nOn cross-examination, Dalponte stated that the photographs of the lineup had been taken in the hallway outside of the lineup room, rather than in the actual lineup room. He did not remember the description he had used to gather the lineup participants.\\nDetective Gene Harris of the Chicago police department then testified that he had told Marshall that there would be five people in the lineup, and there was a possibility that the person he had seen shoot Poo would be there. Harris also stated that defendant had selected his position in the lineup.',\n",

There were not. Defendant was 18 years old; two of the other lineup participants were 20 years old; one was 22 and one was 24. Harris had attempted to physically match the participants in the lineup to defendant, the suspected offender.\\nNext, defendant testified that when he had entered the lineup room, the other four participants were already in there. He was told to take the first position and to walk up to the one-way mirror. Because defendant had not been wearing a shirt at the time of his arrest, the police gave him a black shirt to wear in the lineup. Defendant claimed that he was the only one in the lineup asked to step forward.\\nFollowing the testimony, the trial court denied defendant’s motion to suppress the lineup identification, finding that the lineup was not of such a suggestive nature as to lend a strong likelihood of an irreparable misidentification.',\n",

Poo agreed to go with Marshall; and the two walked down Washington Street toward a nearby hotel, where they intended to buy the cigarettes from a vending machine. As they were walking, three males walked up to them and started talking to Poo. Marshall did not know any of them. At trial, Marshall identified defendant as one of the three males. Defendant, his two companions, Poo and Marshall then continued walking toward the hotel. Poo was walking in front of Marshall with defendant’s two companions, and Marshall was walking behind, next to defendant. While they were walking, defendant kept staring at Marshall’s hat, and Marshall observed defendant put a black glove on his right hand. When Poo lit up a marijuana cigarette, defendant moved up next to Poo to share the marijuana. Marshall stayed behind them. When they arrived at the hotel, one of defendant’s companions remained outside, and everyone else went inside. Once inside, defendant took Marshall’s hat and put it on himself. Marshall just stared at defendant, but did not say anything. Defendant returned the hat to Marshall and everyone left the hotel.',\n",

Marshall then heard someone say, “Freeze, Poo.” Marshall turned around and saw a gunshot spark come from a gun defendant was holding in his gloved hand. Marshall started to run. He assumed Poo had been shot because Poo was not running with him. On direct, Marshall stated that he had heard three shots; during cross-examination, he stated that had heard two or more shots. When Marshall arrived at Poo’s grandmother’s house, he told Poo’s grandmother that Poo had been shot. Subsequently, Marshall viewed two lineups: June 1, 1988, and July 12, 1988. Defendant did not participate in the first lineup. Marshall did not identify anyone at the first lineup, but he did identify defendant in the second lineup.\\nOn cross-examination, Marshall testified that he never saw any photographs taken of the first lineup. He indicated that during the second lineup, each man walked up to the one-way mirror and stepped back, then each man turned to the left and to the right, individually and in unison.

In response, the State indicated that this was the first time it had heard about the mugshot books. The court then suggested that defense counsel query Marshall further as to the mugshot books and see “where we go.” Upon further questioning, Marshall indicated that he had viewed the mugshot books prior to the first lineup, but had not identified anyone. Defense counsel renewed its request for production of the mugshot books. The court denied the request on the grounds that there was nothing to tie those books to this case. Defense counsel then requested that all testimony regarding the mugshot books be stricken. The State agreed.\\nMarshall further testified that he was presently incarcerated for attempted robbery, an offense to which he had pled guilty a few weeks earlier. Marshall stated that he had been offered no deal on the attempted robbery charge in return for his testimony in this case and that his testimony was completely voluntary.\\nOfficer Mike Reyes of the Chicago police department testified that approximately 1:30 a.m. on May 29, 1988, he was in a marked squad car in the vicinity of 2100 W. Washington, Chicago, when he heard approximately five gunshots. Within minutes of hearing the shots, a call came over the police radio that a man had been shot at Hoyne and Washington.

When asked where he had been approximately 7 p.m. on May 28, 1988, Vaughn replied that he did not remember, but that he knew that he had not seen defendant that night. At this point, defense counsel requested a sidebar during which she objected to the State calling Vaughn for the sole purpose of impeaching him with a prior inconsistent statement. In response, the State argued that Vaughn appeared to be a hostile witness in that he was not testifying in accordance with a signed statement he had previously given to the police. The State further argued that because Vaughn’s prior signed and acknowledged statement was inconsistent with his testimony at trial, the prior statement could be introduced as substantive evidence. The court overruled defense counsel’s objection.\\nBack in the presence of the jury, Vaughn testified that the entire statement he had given to the police was a lie and that he had been forced to give a statement implicating his brother.\\nOn cross-examination, Vaughn stated that when the police picked him up, they told him that he was being charged with Poo’s murder. He was then handcuffed, taken to police headquarters, and put in a small interview room. A homicide detective came into the room and asked Vaughn some questions. When Vaughn denied having anything to do with the murder, the detective punched him in the stomach, and kept punching him every time he denied involvement in the murder.',\n",

Vaughn said he had not killed Poo. The first detective then hit Vaughn a few more times, grabbed his wrist and pinned it back like he was going to break it. The officer then handcuffed Vaughn to a pole and beat him for 15 to 20 minutes. The officers left for about 15 minutes, returned, and asked the same question. When Vaughn again denied killing Poo, they started to beat him again. At one point, someone else came into the room, took Vaughn’s picture, and left.\\nThe officers again left the room for about 15 minutes. When they returned, they told Vaughn that they knew defendant, not Vaughn, had murdered Poo, and that if Vaughn did not tell them where defendant was or how defendant had killed Poo, they would continue to beat him and would charge him with Poo’s murder. When Vaughn did not respond, they continued to beat him for another two to three hours. They also continued to threaten him with a murder charge. As a result, Vaughn made up the statement regarding the events of May 28,1988.\\nThe statement Vaughn gave to the police set forth the following: On May 28, 1988, approximately 7 p.m., Vaughn saw defendant, whose nicknames are “PeeWee” and “Mr. Soft,” in the lobby of the apartment building located at 2145 W. Lake. Defendant was with another man. Vaughn did not know the other man’s name, but knew that he was a member of the Black Souls street gang.',\n",

Defendant then told Vaughn that he was going to “get” Poo Holloway. Defendant asked Vaughn if he wanted to go with him, but Vaughn did not go. Vaughn then went to his seventh-floor apartment in that building and, while standing in the apartment hallway, heard gunshots fired. Shortly thereafter, defendant and his companion came up to where Vaughn was standing, and the companion told Vaughn that they had “got them.” When Vaughn asked who they got, defendant answered, “I got Poo Holloway.” At that point, defendant and his companion signalled to a car which had stopped and got into the car. A few minutes later, the police arrived at the scene.\\nVaughn further testified at trial that the day after he gave his statement, he stood in a lineup, but was not identified. Later that day, the police dropped Vaughn off at the “projects” and told him that he had a half hour to find defendant. Whether he found defendant or not, he was to return to that spot in a half hour. Vaughn did not find defendant. When he returned to the drop-off spot, he was scared because he thought the police would either beat him or kill him. The police then drove Vaughn back to the police station and told him that he had one day in which to find defendant.\\nVaughn stated that what he had told the police and the assistant State’s Attorney on May 31 and June 1 was not the truth. He had not seen or talked to defendant on either May 28 or 29. He eventually told the truth to defense counsel in January 1989 because he was tired of feeling that defendant had been arrested for something that Vaughn did not know he had done.

Vaughn was not handcuffed at the time. After Feerick took Vaughn’s statement, Vaughn read the statement. Before he signed it, Feerick asked defendant if he had any trouble signing it, and he replied that he did not, and then signed it.

The trial court granted the motion regarding juvenile convictions, but denied the motion regarding gang affiliation.',\n",

The statement contained the following information: One night, people around the project were saying that defendant had been shot. Vaughn went up to the seventh-floor apartment of his girl friend at 2145 W. Lake and, while there, heard gunshots. The next day Vaughn learned that Poo, not defendant, had been shot. Approximately two days later, the police picked up Vaughn, told him that he was being charged with Poo’s murder, and took him to police headquarters. After being in the interview room for a few minutes, a homicide detective came and asked him why he had killed Poo. When Vaughn denied killing Poo, the detective threatened to beat him. Some other police came into the room and started to beat him. At one point, someone else came in and took his picture.\\nThen, one of the homicide detectives said that he knew defendant, not Vaughn, had killed Poo, and he wanted to know where defendant could be found. When Vaughn told him that he did not know, the officers began to beat him, handcuffed him and beat him again. They then told Vaughn that he better make up a story or they would keep beating him. Finally, Vaughn told them the story about defendant’s involvement, inserting facts that the police had already told him. Later, the police officers put Vaughn in a lineup. After the lineup, an assistant State’s Attorney came in, handed him a typed statement and asked him if that was what he had told the police. He said “yes.” When the assistant State’s Attorney left, the police told Vaughn that he “had done good” and they would not hit him anymore.\\nWhen the assistant State’s Attorney returned with the statement, Vaughn signed it. The police then drove Vaughn to some factories near Western Avenue and told him to see if defendant was in the “projects,” and to come back and tell them. Vaughn did as he was told, but was unable to find defendant.',\n",

Vaughn stated that he had never seen defendant or any members of the Black Souls street gang the night Poo was shot. Moreover, defendant never told Vaughn that he had shot Poo, and Vaughn never saw anyone give defendant a gun. Vaughn further stated that the January 1989 statement was the truth and it was voluntarily given.\\nFollowing introduction of the January 1989 statement into evidence, defendant rested his case. Closing arguments ensued, after which the jury returned with a verdict finding defendant guilty of murder. Judgment was entered on the verdict and defendant was sentenced to 32 years in prison. Defendant’s timely appeal followed.\\nInitially, defendant contends that the trial court erred in allowing the State to use Albert Vaughn’s prior inconsistent statement as substantive evidence because Vaughn did not have personal knowledge of the events and conditions which were the subject of the statement, as required by section 115—10.1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 38, par. 115—10.1). In response, the State does not argue that Vaughn had the requisite personal knowledge. Instead, it argues that even if the trial court erred when it admitted Vaughn’s statement as substantive evidence, the error was harmless.',\n",

Coleman (1989), 187 Ill. App. 3d 541, 547, 543 N.E.2d 555.) The third element is at issue in the present case. “Personal knowledge,” as it is used in section 115—10.1, does not refer to knowledge acquired by being told something. It refers to that which has been seen by the witness. People v. Cooper (1989), 188 Ill. App. 3d 971, 544 N.E.2d 1273; People v. Coleman (1989), 187 Ill. App. 3d 541, 543 N.E.2d 555.\\nIn Cooper, the reviewing court held that the witness’ statement that “Craig Cooper and Walter Eden told me they had just robbed Travis Vaughn” had been erroneously admitted as substantive evidence because it was based on knowledge gained by a conversation with one of the co-conspirators and not from the witness’ perception of the robbery itself. Similarly, in Coleman, the reviewing court found prior inconsistent statements of two witnesses to have been improperly admitted because the statements consisted primarily of admissions of defendant which were overheard by the witnesses. The witnesses had not actually observed the subject of the statements.',\n",

Vaughn personally observed or personally heard: (1) defendant and another man he knew to be a member of the Black Souls street gang in the lobby of the building at 2145 W. Lake, on Saturday, May 28, 1988, approximately 7 p.m.; (2) early the next morning, approximately 12:30 a.m., Vaughn again saw defendant and his companion; (3) at that time, Vaughn saw the companion hand defendant a gun; (4) defendant told Vaughn that he was going to get Poo Holloway; (5) defendant asked Vaughn if he wanted to go with him; (6) after defendant left, Vaughn heard gunshots fired; (7) approximately 1:30 a.m., defendant and his companion returned to Vaughn’s apartment; (8) defendant and his companion signalled to a car which had stopped; (9) defendant and his companion got into the car; and (10) the police arrived. Because all of the preceding events had been personally observed or personally heard by Vaughn, they were admissible as substantive evidence under section 115—10.1. However, Vaughn had not personally seen or heard the events which were the subject of the following statements made by defendant and his companion to Vaughn: the statement by defendant’s companion that they had “got them” and defendant’s statement, “I got Poo Holloway.” He had merely heard statements about the events. Accordingly, the trial court erred in allowing those portions of the statement to be admitted as substantive evidence.',\n",

The decision date is (1991-09-23)\\n\\nAlthough the trial court erred in admitting certain portions of the statement, it was not reversible error. The standard for determining whether error is harmless or reversible is whether it is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Error may be harmless if it is in itself inconsequential or if, when balanced against the State’s evidence, the State’s evidence establishes defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. (People v. Cooper (1989), 188 Ill. App. 3d 971, 544 N.E.2d 1273.) In the present case, in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt established by the uncontradicted eyewitness testimony of Marvin Marshall, and corroborated by the admissible portion of the June 1 statement of Albert Vaughn, we conclude that any error was harmless.\\nNext, defendant argues that the trial court erred in not holding a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine the voluntariness of Vaughn’s prior inconsistent statement. At trial, Vaughn stated that his entire statement to the police was a lie and that he had given the statement so that the police would stop beating him and to avoid being charged with Poo’s murder. Three State’s witnesses testified to the contrary.\\nIn raising this argument, defendant has failed to cite to any statutory or common law authority that requires the trial court to hold a hearing to determine voluntariness. It is well established that points raised, but not supported by citation to relevant authority, fail to satisfy the requirements of Supreme Court Rule 341(e)(7) and are, therefore, waived for review. (People v. Felella (1989), 131 Ill. 2d 525, 546 N.E.2d 492.) Further, we note that the record does not indicate that defendant ever requested such a hearing.',\n",

The test for voluntariness is whether the statement was made freely and without compulsion or inducement of any sort. (People v. Haymer (1987), 154 Ill. App. 3d 760, 506 N.E.2d 1378.) The court looks to the totality of circumstances to see if the statement had been voluntarily given. The trial court need not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, but the State must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the statement was made without any compulsion of any sort. The finding of the trial court that the statement was voluntary will not be disturbed on review unless it is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. People v. Hattery (1989), 183 Ill. App. 3d 785, 539 N.E.2d 368.\\nIn the present case, defendant contends that Vaughn’s statement was extracted after 29 hours of intermittent interrogation, threats and physical abuse. As previously discussed, Vaughn testified that on May 31, 1988, he was taken to police headquarters in handcuffs and was told that he was a suspect in the murder of Poo Holloway. Once at the station, Detective Summerville read him his Miranda rights. Vaughn stated that he was placed in an interrogation room and beaten and threatened until he finally gave a statement implicating defendant.',\n",

After Vaughn’s statement, Summerville left the station to look for defendant. When he could not find him, he returned to the station. According to Summerville, Vaughn was willing to remain at the station until they found defendant. Summerville said Vaughn was cooperative the entire time and even agreed to participate in a lineup on June 1. Summerville denied hitting or threatening Vaughn and never saw or heard anyone else do so. Summerville further stated that Vaughn was never in custody or under arrest.\\nMaureen Feerick, assistant State’s Attorney, testified that when Vaughn gave her his statement on the evening of June 1, he was cooperative, alert, coherent, pleasant and in no apparent physical pain. When she was alone with him, she had asked him if he had any trouble signing the statement and he had said, “No.”\\nBased on the testimony of Detective Summerville and Assistant State’s Attorney Feerick, we find that the State has met its burden of proof as to the voluntariness of Vaughn’s statement. Moreover, we note that after the alleged physical abuse Vaughn had received from the police, it is likely that there would have been some level of discomfort visible to Feerick, who had interviewed defendant shortly after the police had questioned him. Yet, she saw nothing and, in fact, found Vaughn to be very pleasant and not in any pain. Accordingly, we find that the trial court’s determination as to the voluntariness of Vaughn’s statement was not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.',\n",

Defendant contends that Officer Chambers’ testimony regarding his arrest for an unrelated crime was prejudicial because it admitted evidence of other crimes and it imputed gang activity to defendant. The State responds that Officer Chambers’ testimony was relevant and admissible because it revealed facts and circumstances leading to defendant’s arrest and it presented evidence of defendant’s consciousness of guilt.

Respondent, GSH Enterprises, Ltd. (GSH), an Illinois corporation, owns and operates a retail grocery and liquor business at 4356 West Madison Street pursuant to a lease executed between GSH and James Davis, the prior owner of the property.\\nAfter receiving a tax deed and making a demand for possession on all tenants, Olmstead filed a petition for possession on the basis that the issuance of the tax deed cancelled all existing leases relating to the property. GSH filed a motion in opposition, claiming that there was no basis for terminating its lease because it did not affect the merchantable title the tax deed conveyed to Olmstead. After a hearing, the trial court entered an order granting Olmstead possession of the leased properties.\\nOn appeal, GSH asserts that its leasehold interest survives the issuance of the tax deed, which granted merchantable title to Olmstead. Not only is its lease a benefit to the property, GSH argues, but a retail store lease for a reasonable length at market rates freely negotiated between landlord and tenant is not a lien or encumbrance on the property. GSH contends that the legislature provided that the tax deed recipient receive merchantable title instead of allowing all leases to be cancelled by the issuance of a tax deed.',\n",

The decision date is (1995-02-01)\\n\\nOlmstead responds that the lease was automatically cancelled by the issuance of the tax deed because the Act was intended to convey to the tax deed purchaser a title that is free and clear of all prior interests and claims. He contends that the lease lowers the property’s market value, hinders its transferability, and opens it to the possibility of litigation.\\nBased on the following reasoning, we affirm.\\nIn order to return tax delinquent properties to the tax rolls and to provide greater stability for tax deeds, the State legislature substantially revised the Revenue Act in 1951. (In re Application of County Treasurer (1982), 92 Ill. 2d 400, 406, 442 N.E.2d 216.) Section 266 was amended to provide that \"this section shall be liberally construed so that tax deeds herein provided for shall convey merchantable title.” (35 ILCS 205/266 (West 1992).) The purpose of the legislation relating to tax deeds is to provide a method for obtaining merchantable title (In re Application of Cook County Treasurer (1981), 100 Ill. App. 3d 534, 426 N.E.2d 997) so that the collection of real estate taxes will increase and land will be free to once again enter the stream of commerce (Cherin v. R&C Co. (1957), 11 Ill. 2d 447, 452, 143 N.E.2d 235). The legislature intended that a tax deed grant title free from any cloud that could affect the property’s marketability and its successful return to the tax rolls. (Cherin, 11 Ill. 2d at 452.) The statute also gives the tax deed holder the right to possession. 35 ILCS 205/266 (West 1992).',\n",

The decision date is (1995-02-01)\\n\\nWhether title to real estate is merchantable is a question of law for the court. (Wilfong v. W.A. Schickedanz Agency, Inc. (1980), 85 Ill. App. 3d 333, 337, 406 N.E.2d 828.) Merchantable title is a title that a reasonably prudent person would accept as not subject to doubt or cloud that would affect its market value. (Jones v. Melrose Park National Bank (1992), 228 Ill. App. 3d 249, 256, 592 N.E.2d 562.) While it is not perfect record title (Wilfong, 85 Ill. App. 3d at 337), it is title that is readily transferred and reasonably secure against litigation or flaws decreasing market value. Jones, 228 Ill. App. 3d at 256; Wilfong, 85 Ill. App. 3d at 337.\\nWhen a tax deed is conveyed pursuant to section 266, any prior existing liens become void. (Lincoln Park Federal Savings & Loan Association v. DRG, Inc. (1988), 175 Ill. App. 3d 176, 529 N.E.2d 771.) Although a lease is not an existing lien like a mortgage or a mechanic’s lien, it is an encumbrance. A lease conveys a lesser interest than a deed and gives possession of the leased premises for the full term of the lease. 8930 South Harlem, Ltd. v. Moore (1979), 77 Ill. 2d 212, 220, 396 N.E.2d 1.\\nOlmstead further argues that GSH, which received notice as an interested party, lost any interest it had in the property because it did not exercise its right to redeem the taxes. To support that argument, Olmstead relies on People v. Cottine (1959), 20 Ill. App. 2d 562, 156 N.E.2d 774, where the issue was whether an alleged lessee had received notice of the issuance of the tax deed. The court determined that the alleged lessee was estopped from asserting any rights it had under the statute because he had received notice.\\nAlthough Cottine did not address the issue of whether a leasehold interest interferes with a merchantable title, its reasoning is helpful. In this case, GSH received notice, did not redeem the taxes, and did not object to the issuance of the tax deed. Only when Olmstead sought possession did GSH involve itself.',\n",

The decision date is (1909-05-19)\\n\\nThe contract for the sale and purchase of the land offered in evidence by plaintiffs was an executory and not an executed contract. Upon the refusal of the defendant to comply with the provisions of such contract two remedies were available to the plaintiffs, viz.: One an action at law to recover damages for its breach, the measure of such damages being the difference between the market value of the property on April 1, 1907, and the contract price; and the other a suit in equity for specific performance of the contract. In an action at law plaintiffs cannot recover the contract price for the land and still retain possession and title to the land. Elder v. Hood, 38 Ill. 533, relied upon by appellants, is not in point, because the contract there involved was an executed contract. Whether the note for $2,000 payable to the order of John W. Dickson, mentioned in the contract as having been executed by the defendant as a forfeit in the event of his failing to comply with his part of the agreement, be treated as a penalty or the amount agreed upon as liquidated damages in the event of a breach of the contract by the defendant, no recovery was sought upon said note by the declaration, and no recovery could be had thereon in this suit because the note was made payable to one of the plaintiffs individually. Plaintiffs were not entitled to a recovery in this suit under either count of their declaration and the court did not err in refusing to admit the evidence offered and in giving to the jury a peremptory instruction.

The decision date is (1981-07-16)\\n\\nThe following facts were adduced at the trial: Police Officer Brown testified that at approximately 11 a.m., on November 8, 1978, he entered the Cheyenne Social Club. At that time Officer Brown observed defendant who was an employee of that club. Defendant then showed Officer Brown a scratch sheet which contained race track information on races that were going to be run on that date. After looking at this, Officer Brown indicated to defendant that he wished to make a horse wager. Defendant responded that the officer would have to become a member of the club for $5 prior to placing such wager. Defendant indicated to Officer Brown that after he joined the club he would be entitled to participate in various club activities, one of which was a race track service. Officer Brown then told defendant that he wished to join thé club, and defendant presented him with a club application which the police officer read and signed. Defendant then presented Officer Brown with a Cheyenne Social Club membership card, which Officer Brown also signed. When this was completed, Officer Brown informed defendant that he wanted to bet on the daily double race at Hawthorne Park. Defendant took the order and wrote this information on a parimutuel ticket under the heading, “Sure-Win, Incorporated.” Officer Brown gave defendant a $10 bill, whose serial number had been recorded previously by the police. Officer Brown’s bet for the daily double at Hawthorne on that date was the number 5 horse in the first race and the number 2 horse in the second race. Defendant gave Officer Brown $3 in change and a pink copy of the bet record as a receipt. When this was completed defendant indicated to the police officer that $5 was to join the club and $2 was for the bet. At this point Officer Brown asked defendant how he could pick up his winnings in the event either of his selections won the first or second race. Defendant replied that he could pick them up at the club. Defendant stated that the club',\n",

We cannot agree with either contention.\\nSection 39.1(a) of the Illinois Horse Racing Act of 1975 states as follows:\\n“No person shall, for a fee, directly or indirectly, accept anything of value from another to be transmitted or delivered for wager in any pari-mutuel or certificate system of wagering on horse races. Nothing in this Section prohibits wagering transactions authorized under this Act.” Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, eh. 8, par. 37 — 39.1(a).\\nIn Finish Line Express, Inc. v. City of Chicago (1978), 72 Ill. 2d 131, 379 N.E.2d 290, a corporation operating a race track messenger service brought an action in the circuit court of Cook County, which challenged the constitutionality of the above described section of the Illinois Horse Racing Act. In that case, the plaintiff corporation, at locations away from the track, accepted money from wagerers who directed the plaintiff corporation to purchase a certain ticket in the pari-mutuel pool at the race track. The bettor was charged 10 percent of the wager for this service. The supreme court held that plaintiff corporation’s business was gambling and that, as such, it was within the State’s police power to regulate gaming activity. The court stated:\\n“It is well within the authority of the State of Illinois to limit gambling on horse races to those who are at the track betting for themselves or betting for others only as a courtesy and not for a fee. In essence, this statute is part of the State’s regulatory plan for limited gambling, and we find nothing in the Illinois or Federal constitutions which prevents its enactment or enforcement of such a statute.” 72 Ill. 2d 131, 140.',\n",

The decision date is (1981-07-16)\\n\\nIn the present case defendant maintains that there was insufficient evidence to convict him because the State did not prove the acceptance of a monetary fee for the wager that was to be placed at the race track for the police officer. However, the testimony indicates that the only way a person could place a bet at the Cheyenne Social Club was to pay a fee of $5 to become a member of the club. Police Officer Brown gave defendant $10 to place a $2 bet at Hawthorne Park and received $3 back in change and a pink copy as a receipt. Defendant indicated that the $3 change remained after collection of a $5 fee to join the club and $2 for the cost of the ticket. Clearly, the $5 fee constituted an indirect fee accepted by defendant to place a wager for Officer Brown. This indirect fee was in violation of section 39.1(a) of the Horse Racing Act.\\nDefendant notes that the trial court stated that the State was required to prove that the services were strictly for the purpose of gambling, and he also notes that there was some evidence that legitimate services were also offered by the club as part of the membership fee. However the trial court further concluded that no other services were in fact offered by the Cheyenne Social Club and that the only purpose for the club’s operation was to accept bets. Indeed, even if the payment of the $5 fee was shown to have entitled the payor to participation in other activities it is clear that the payment also constituted an indirect fee for the placement of a wager and thus violated the statute. Accordingly, we find no error here since it is well settled that the controlling determination before a reviewing court is the correctness of the trial court’s conclusion, not the validity of its rationale. (People v. Tobe (1971), 49 Ill. 2d 538, 547, 276 N.E.2d 294.) We believe the trial court’s finding of guilt was proper.',\n",

Defendant cites this statement as evidence that he was improperly required to prove his innocence. Our determination that such proof would not properly have affected defendant’s guilt vitiates this argument. Moreover, we believe that the trial court’s finding of guilt was based on the testimony of Officer Brown and not on defendant’s failure to offer evidence. In a bench trial, the weight to be given to the evidence presented and the inferences to be drawn therefrom are matters for the decision of the trial court, and a reviewing court will not substitute its judgment unless the proof is so unsatisfactory as to justify a reasonable doubt of guilt. (People v. Withers (1979), 69 Ill. App. 3d 568, 570, 387 N.E.2d 1007.)

Tbe evidence shows that the residuary legatee waá assistant pastor to the testator and there is some evidence tending to show that a fiduciary relation existed and that the will and the other instrument were prepared by the residuary legatee. The evidence also shows that the testator had the idea, for many years prior to his death, that a priest should not leave his money to his relations, but to charity, and that the public should hot know what became of his property. He wanted to keep the final disposition of his estate away from the public and to do so he said that he would leave his property to some one, as his executor, and then give his executor instructions as to how he wanted his estate distributed.\\nIt was shown that on May 5,1895, and on March 10, 1905, the testator had made previous wills.

The decision date is (1922-03-24)\\n\\nAppellants contend that under the facts and circumstances in evidence there was a presumption of undue influence on the part of the residuary legatee and for that reason the court should have submitted the case, to the jury instead of directing a verdict. They rely upon the rule that where a person holding a confidential relation' to a testator has himself prepared a will by which he receives a substantial benefit, these facts, unexplained, sustain the charge that the will was procured by the undue influence of the beneficiary. Gum v. Reep, 275 Ill. 503. But the existence of a fiduciary relation between a testator and a legatee does not raise a presumption of undue influence in the case of a will. The presumption arises only out of the fact that the legatee prepared the will by which he benefited. Wunderlich v. Buerger, 287 Ill. 440. In that ease the lawyer who wrote the will was a substantial beneficiary and the will was sustained because it appeared that there was no undue influence.\\nIt will be observed, therefore, that the presumption of undue influence arises only when a legatee prepares a will by which he benefits. Appellants showed by their bill that appellee was not to receive any benefit whatever from the legacy. This is evidenced by the instrument signed by the testator at the time he executed his will and which appellee admitted by his answer and agreed to carry out according to its terms.. If appellee were to receive the legacy absolutely for his own benefit, there would be a presumption of undue influence which it would be necessary for him to overcome. But the undisputed evidence shows that such was not the fact and the presumption was rebutted. In re O’Hara’s Will, 95 N. Y. 403.\",\n",

The decision date is (1922-03-24)\\n\\nAppellants contend that there was no animus testandi on the part of the testator. They say that although the testator made a will in due form of law, yet it was not his intention to dispose of his estate as therein provided, but in an entirely different manner as evidenced by another instrument. They say that he deliberately intended to evade the statute of wills and that the courts should not give effect to his alleged will.\\nHow may animus testandi be expressed? This question is very forcefully answered by Barnewall v. Murrell, 108 Ala. 366; In re Kennedy’s Estate, 159 Mich. 548, and Heaston v. Krieg, 167 Ind. 101, where it was said: ‘ ‘ There is no other mode of giving a valid expression to the animus testandi, than that which the statute prescribes. Whatever form the expression may assume, whatever solemnity may accompany it, the statute declares it ineffectual, unless the formalities it prescribes are observed. When these formalities are observed, if the writing be testamentary, —if it imports a posthumous destination of property, —the statute in itself and of itself attaches, and conclusively attaches, the animus testandi\\nSo when a testator has expressed animus testandi in the form of a will duly executed in accordance with the formal requirements of the statute, parol or extrinsic .evidence is not admissible for the purpose of showing that he did not intend to make a will. Barnewall v. Murrell, supra; In re Kennedy’s Estate, supra; Heaston v. Krieg, supra. While there are decisions to the contrary, we are of the opinion that the rule above announced is more in accord with settled principles of law and the views of our Supreme Court.',\n",

But an ordinary statutory form of deed, even \"though attested by two credible wetnesses, cannot be probated as a will where there is no ambiguity in the deed, which on its face purports to convey a present interest and which can only be converted into a testamentary disposition by resort to parol evidence to show that the grantor did not intend it to take effect until his death.

The decision date is (1922-03-24)\\n\\nIt seems to us, under the holdings of our Supreme Court, that when a person has expressed animus testcmdi by the execution of a will in strict accordance with the requirements of the statute, extrinsic evidence is inadmissible for the purpose of showing that he did not intend thereby to dispose of his property by the will. The admission- of extrinsic evidence for such a purpose, would be in direct violation of section 17 of the \"Wills Act unless it was such an instrument or act as is mentioned in said section. The instrument in question is not of the character required by that statute and cannot be permitted to defeat the will.\\nThere was no rule of law to prevent the testator from leaving his property to his legatee and at the same time requiring him to dispose of it in a manner directed in another instrument or even on verbal directions. If at the time of making the will the testator has formed the intention that a legacy thereby given shall be disposed of in a particular manner not disclosed by the will but assented to by the legatee at or before, or possibly subsequent, to the making of the will, a court of equity will allow such trust to be proved by the admissions of the legatee or other parol evidence; and such action does not amount to changing the will by verbal agreement or revoking it by spoken words.

The will remained as it was written. It was not changed because of the' promise. Neither can it be doubted that had the promise not been made it would not have remained as written.’ ” Such is practically the unanimous holding of the courts. Trustees of Amherst College v.

A. 1918F 1038 and note.\\nIn Trustees of Amherst College v. Ritch, 151 N.

The theory is that the will has full effect, by passing an absolute legacy to the legatee, and that then equity, in order to defeat fraud, raises a trust in favor of those intended to be benefited by the testator, and compels the legatee, as a trustee ex malificio, to turn the gift over to them. * * * Neither the statute of frauds nor the statute of wills applies, because the will takes effect as written and proved.”\\nIn the case of In re O’Hara’s Will, 95 N. Y. 403; objections were presented to the probate of the will which gave the residuary estate to a legatee absolutely, but he was required by other directions to distribute it in a certain manner. While the probate was pending, a suit in chancery was brought in which it was claimed that the alleged trust violated the rule against perpetuities and the court,, having both cases before it, sustained that contention but upheld the probate of the will and held that the legatee was a trustee for the heirs at law.\",\n",

He met with an injury to one eye on August 26, 1897, from which he was laid up about thirteen weeks. After recovering he returned to his work, and on August 2, 1899, he brought a suit against his employer, the Union Drop Forge Company, for damages on account of the injury. On October 21, 1899, he was discharged by William G. Holbrook, the president and treasurer of the company. At that time he had been working for the company about ten 'years, but his employment was at the will of the parties and he had no contract for future employment. He was without employment until the first part of December, 1899, when he secured work elsewhere. In his suit he claimed $10,000 damages, and the Union Drop Forge Company was insured by the defendant against accidents and injuries of the character for which the suit was brought.

The plaintiff belonged to a labor union, and he went with a committee of that union to see Holbrook. The plaintiff and two members of the committee testified that Holbrook said his company was satisfied with plaintiff’s work and would be willing to put him back at work but could not do it; that his company had an agreement with the defendant, and if they would get a letter from Post he would re-employ plaintiff. They further testified that they then went to see Post, and Post said that they had caused the discharge and did not intend to let plaintiff work to earn money to fight them with, and that he did not propose to have plaintiff go to work there or anywhere else if he could prevent it. There was evidence for defendant, by Holbrook, that when his company was sued he called up Post, the manager of the defendant, and advised with him as to whether it would be necessary or advisable or expedient to keep the plaintiff in their employ under the circumstances; that Post said they could use their own judgment, and that it was on their own judgment and on their own motion that the discharge was made. The letters which passed between Holbrook and Post tended to substantiate that version of the affair, and, of course, it is conceded that the Union Drop Forge Company could discharge the plaintiff whenever it saw fit, because he had brought a suit against it, or for any other reason, or for no reason at all and through malice.

Their evidence was that Post said it did not make any particular difference to the defendant whether the Union Drop Forge Company re-employed plaintiff or not; that he made no statement or admission that he or the defendant had procured the discharge of plaintiff, and that the conversation consisted only of a discussion between him and the committee as to the propriety of an employer keeping a laborer in his employ who had a suit pending against him which the employer believed to be without merit, and as to what course the members of the committee would themselves take under the same circumstances.',\n",

That conviction was affirmed by this court on appeal. (People v. Manns, 1 Ill.App.3d 871, 274 N.E.2d 194.) On January 11, 1973, the appellant filed a petition in the circuit court seeking relief pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 110, sec. 72. The section 72 petition was denied by the trial judge, who had participated in the original trial.\\nThe appellant subsequently asked the circuit court to modify his sentence. The appellant had been placed upon three years probation conditioned upon paying a fine of $500 and serving a term of 90 days at the State Farm. The Unified Code of Corrections became effective on January 1, 1973, and the Code prohibits, as a condition of a sentence of probation, a sentence to a period of imprisonment (Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, sec. 1005—6—3(d)). An exception to that rule is that a sentencing court may order periodic imprisonment as a condition of probation. The circuit court, attempting to render the appellant’s sentence consistent with the new Code, modified the sentence so that the appellant was to serve weekends in the Madison County Jail for one year. The modification resulted in a sentence of incarceration of 104 days in the county jail, whereas the original order resulted in the 90-day period of incarceration at the State Farm. The three-year period of probation and the $500 fine remained a part of the penalty imposed.\\nThe appellant seeks relief from both the judgment denying section 72 relief and the order modifying his sentence.\\nIll. Rev. Stat., ch. 110, sec. 72, provides:\\n“The petition must be filed not later than two years after the entry of the order, judgment or decree. Time during which person seeking relief is under legal disability or duress or the ground for relief is fraudulently concealed shall be excluded in computing the period of two years.”',\n",

The motion filed under section 72 must be filed within two years from the entry of judgment. (People v. Colletti, 48 Ill.2d 135.) The appellant failed to file his section 72 petition within two years of the final judgment convicting him of theft.

Rev. Stats. 1953 [Jones Ill. Stats. Ann. 104057(1)]. The decree in substance removes from the property of plaintiff a 25-foot building line restriction appearing on a recorded plat.\\nThe complaint and answer were referred to a master for hearing. The master heard the evidence, made his findings of fact and conclusions of law, and recommended the entry of a decree to remove the restriction. Objections were filed by defendant to the master’s report, which, were allowed to stand as exceptions. Upon a hearing before the chancellor the exceptions to the report were overruled and the decree entered, sustaining the master’s findings and conclusions.\\nThe complaint, as amended, alleges in substance that plaintiff is the owner of lots 8 and 9 in block 2 in a subdivision in Chicago, which lots front on the south side of 67th Street between Crandon Avenue on the west and Oglesby Avenue on the east; that defendant Eisenberg is the owner of lot 7 in said block and defendants Simpson and Gustafson own lots 1 to 6, both inclusive; that said nine lots occupy the entire block; that lots 1 and 9 are corner lots, each 67 feet wide and 150 feet deep; that the remaining lots are 30 feet wide and 150 feet deep; that said subdivision was platted in 1892 when 67th Street was a residential street designed for one-family dwellings; and that to maintain uniformity of the parkway a 25-foot building line was drawn on the plat of said subdivision at the time it was recorded on October 10, 1892.',\n",

The decision date is (1954-11-24)\\n\\nUpon the evidence heard by the master, he found that plaintiff owns the two lots in question; that they front on 67th Street across from Jackson Park in Chicago; that the neighborhood of the property involved is improved with large multi-dwelling buildings, and with one or two exceptions they are built to the lot lines; and that the retention of the restriction injures the property rights of plaintiff and makes it impractical and unfeasible to erect a building consistent with the present land value of the property, which would comply with the building ordinance of Chicago that requires a parking area within the 25-foot building restriction line. He recommended that a declaratory judgment be entered, removing the building line restriction and enjoining the defendants from maintaining any action based on plaintiff’s effort to erect any improvement on the property.\\nUpon a former appeal to this court (Fink v. Simpson, 349 Ill. App. 243), it was held that the complaint stated a cause of action for a declaratory judgment and directed the trial court to require an answer. Having held the complaint sufficient, the only question remaining for us to determine is whether there is any substantial proof to support the averments in the complaint.\\nDefendant urges there is no proof of ownership of the lots by plaintiff, as alleged in the complaint. The master found from the evidence that plaintiff is the owner. No objection to that finding was filed by defendant nor was any exception preserved to that finding and raised before the chancellor. It is raised for the first time upon this appeal. Had the defendant raised the objection before the master, it would have afforded plaintiff an opportunity to supply, if necessary, any deficiency in the proof as to ownership. Under such circumstances the question cannot be raised for the first time upon appeal. Lager v. Rea, 344 Ill. App. 438, 444; Blanchard v. Lewis, 414 Ill. 515, 521; People ex rel. Nelson v.

Fasbinder was issued a ticket for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in violation of section 11 — 501(a) of the Illinois Vehicle Code (Code) (625 ILCS 5/11 — 501(a) (West 1992)). Police asked defendant to submit to a breath test. Defendant consented, and the test showed his blood-alcohol concentration to be 0.18. Pursuant to sections 11 — 501.1 and 6 — 208.1(a)(4) of the Code (625 ILCS 5/11 — 501.1, 6 — 208.1(a)(4) (West 1992)), defendant’s driver’s license was summarily suspended for a period of one year. Defendant filed a petition to rescind his summary suspension, which was subsequently denied by the trial court. Defendant appealed. This court affirmed the denial to rescind summary suspension. People v. Fasbinder, No. 4 — 95 — 0418 (February 9, 1996) (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23).\\nDefendant in the present case moved to dismiss the DUI charge on the grounds that the summary suspension of his driver’s license was penal in nature and, therefore, his subsequent prosecution for DUI was barred by the double jeopardy clauses of the United States Constitution and the Illinois Constitution. U.S. Const., amend. V; Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, § 10. Defendant now appeals the trial court’s denial of his motion to dismiss. 145 Ill. 2d R. 604(f) (providing for the appeal of a denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds).',\n",

The decision date is (1996-03-27)\\n\\nThe Second District Appellate Court recently considered this question in a case where the summary suspension was rescinded in an agreed order and the defendant then moved to dismiss the DUI charges. People v. Dvorak, 276 Ill. App. 3d 544, 658 N.E.2d 869 (1995). In Dvorak, the court considered the Supreme Court’s decisions in United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435, 104 L. Ed. 2d 487, 109 S. Ct. 1892 (1989) (statutory penalty of $130,000 for Medicare overcharges of $585), Austin v. United States, 509 U.S. 602, 125 L. Ed. 2d 488, 113 S. Ct. 2801 (1993) (forfeiture of property used to facilitate drug-related crimes), and Department of Revenue v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U.S. 767, 128 L. Ed. 2d 767, 114 S. Ct. 1937 (1994) (tax imposed on illegal drugs following criminal penalty for same conduct). The second district rejected the argument that the test to be used, in determining whether summary suspension of driving privileges constitutes punishment, is whether such suspension \" \\'cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose.’ ” Dvorak, 276 Ill. App. 3d at 549, 658 N.E.2d at 874, quoting Halper, 490 U.S. at 448, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 502, 109 S. Ct. at 1902. The second district found the following language more instructive: \" \\'the determination whether a given civil sanction constitutes punishment in the relevant sense requires a particularized assessment of the penalty imposed and the purposes that the penalty may fairly be said to serve.’ ” Dvorak, 276 Ill. App. 3d at 547, 658 N.E.2d at 873, quoting Halper, 490 U.S. at 448, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 501, 109 S. Ct. at 1901.',\n",

The decision date is (1996-03-27)\\n\\nAccording to the second district, the administrative statutory summary suspension of one’s privilege to drive is clearly remedial in nature, designed to protect persons who travel the highways, and not punishment for double jeopardy purposes. Dvorak, 276 Ill. App. 3d at 551, 658 N.E.2d at 875, citing People v. Esposito, 121 Ill. 2d 491, 501, 521 N.E.2d 873, 877 (1988), and People v. Wegielnik, 152 Ill. 2d 418, 425, 605 N.E.2d 487, 490 (1992). Even though the suspension of the privilege to drive may have the incidental effect of deterring impaired drivers, that does not automatically mark the suspension as a form of punishment. Dvorak, 276 Ill. App. 3d at 551, 658 N.E.2d at 875-76. The second district noted that its holding was similar to that in other license suspension cases, such as those involving a physician’s license, and was supported by the nearly unanimous decisions of other states holding that summary suspension of a driver’s license did not bar further prosecution for DUI. Dvorak, 276 Ill. App. 3d at 551-52, 658 N.E.2d at 876.\\nDvorak was decided prior to the supreme court’s decision in In re P.S., 169 Ill. 2d 260 (1996). In P.S. the supreme court held that the forfeiture of a defendant’s car under the Drug Asset Forfeiture Procedure Act (725 ILCS 150/1 et seq. (West 1992) (formerly Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 561/2, par. 1671 et seq.)) prevented defendant’s further prosecution on the charge of unlawful possession of a controlled substance, cocaine. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 561/2, par. 1402(c). The supreme court upheld forfeitures, however, in cases where the forfeitures and criminal charges each required proof of an element which the other did not.',\n",

If so, the forfeiture will be considered punishment for purposes of the double jeopardy clause.” P.S., 169 Ill. 2d at 282. In response to the State’s argument that the proportionality test of Halper should be applied to determine the fairness of the forfeiture, the supreme court said \"Austin appears to have specifically rejected a case-by-case approach, opting for a more categorical approach to forfeitures of conveyances used to facilitate the transportation, etc., of contraband.” P.S., 169 Ill. 2d at 285-86. There is no reason to believe, however, that the categorical approach which Austin and P.S. applied to forfeiture statutes would be applied to license suspensions and revocations. Forfeiture statutes have historically been understood as punishment (P.S., 169 Ill. 2d at 281), while the summary suspension of drivers’ licenses has been viewed as having a purpose of making the highways safer (Esposito, 121 Ill. 2d at 501, 521 N.E.2d at 877; Wegielnik, 152 Ill. 2d at 425, 605 N.E.2d at 490).',\n",

Retribution and deterrence are said to be the traditional aims of punishment. \" \\'[Rjetribution and deterrence are not legitimate nonpunitive governmental objectives.’ ” Halper, 490 U.S. at 448, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 502, 109 S. Ct. at 1902, quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 539 n.20, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447, 468 n.20, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 1874 n.20 (1979). Halper involved a civil penalty which would deter crime in the same manner as would a fine. The summary suspension statute, however, does not attempt to deter conduct in the way that a fine or prison sentence deters individuals from committing crime. The summary suspension statute attempts to deter conduct like any other licensing statute does — by keeping unqualified individuals from situations where they have a special potential to harm members of the public. The summary suspension statute does not produce any financial gain for government, either in the form of a fine or reimbursement of expenses.\\nWe conclude that Dvorak remains good law following the supreme court’s decision in P.S. The summary suspension of a driver’s license is fairly characterized as a remedial civil sanction rather than as punishment for double jeopardy purposes. Dvorak, 276 Ill.

Stat. 1989, ch. 120, par. 2151 et seq.), where the party from whom the tax was sought had already been convicted and sentenced on criminal charges involving the same contraband. Wilson v.

Wilson, 169 Ill. 2d at 313. The court did, however, differentiate a drug tax from standard tax assessments, concluding a drug tax is a form of punishment, designed not for revenue but to quash the drug trade.

Marias testified that when Transload needed additional labor, it would call Tandem for additional employees, and Tandem would send employees pursuant to that request. According to Marias, Transload signed off on the hours worked by plaintiff on a daily time sheet, and plaintiff was paid by Tandem after submitting a time ticket indicating the number of hours he had worked. The time ticket contained multiple terms and conditions, such as: Transload was not allowed to entrust Tandem employees with unattended premises or valuables, and Transload could not use Tandem employees to operate dangerous or unprotected equipment. Marias testified that Tandem was not reimbursed by Transload for workers’ compensation or pension payments. Marias was not aware of any workers’ compensation claim that plaintiff made, and he testified that if Tandem had asked Transload to reimburse Tandem for any of the expenses incurred as part of the workers’ compensation claim, it would have refused.',\n",

The decision date is (2008-03-04)\\n\\nPlaintiff filed a motion to reconsider, claiming for the first time that he never consented to being Transload’s borrowed employee. Attached to this motion was his affidavit in which he maintained that it was not his understanding that he was a Transload employee, and he never consented to being one. The trial court granted Transload’s motion to strike the affidavit because it was not newly discovered evidence and denied plaintiffs motion to reconsider.\\nOn appeal, plaintiff contends the trial court erred in granting Transload’s motion to dismiss. Plaintiff argues that a central inquiry into whether he was a borrowed employee is whether he consented to being Transload’s employee, and there is no evidence that he gave such consent. Plaintiff maintains he had no reason to believe he was a Transload employee because he was paid by Tandem. Moreover, his belief that he was not a Transload employee was shared by Transload based upon the testimony of Charles Marias, Transload’s president, that it was not contacted with respect to reimbursing Tandem for any workers’ compensation expenses, and according to Marias, if Tandem made such a request, it would refuse to pay it. Accordingly, plaintiff claims that Transload cannot now seek the protection of the exclusive remedy provision of the Act when it did not regard itself as a borrowing employer.\\nPlaintiff also asserts that he was not a borrowed employee because he did not occupy a status equal to that of Transload’s other employees since he was not entrusted with unattended premises or valuables and could not operate dangerous or unprotected equipment while working on Transload’s premises. According to plaintiff, these factors create a question of fact as to whether Transload was a borrowing employer and the trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss.',\n",

App. 3d 845, the plaintiff was employed by Personnel Pool, a company that supplied temporary factory workers to defendant Abbott Products. Evans, 150 Ill. App. 3d at 846. After being assigned to work for the defendant, the plaintiff was injured and subsequently filed a complaint against the defendant. Evans, 150 Ill. App. 3d at 846. The trial court granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss, finding that the exclusivity provision of the Act applied to the defendant as a borrowing employer. Evans, 150 Ill. App. 3d at 847. This court affirmed, noting that the defendant was a borrowing employer and had the right to control the plaintiffs work activities and the right to discharge the plaintiff. Evans, 150 Ill.

Although the plaintiff argued that a question of fact remained as to whether he could be considered an employee of Abbott, this court held that the existence of an employer-employee relationship is determined under the definition of the rights and duties of loaning and borrowing employers and that, as a matter of law, plaintiff was “clearly *** a loaned employee.” Evans, 150 Ill.

While the time ticket placed some restrictions on his employment, Doug Stone stated that he had the right to discharge plaintiff for any reason, set plaintiffs schedule, and control his work, all of which indicate that Transload exercised a large degree of control over plaintiffs employment. Plaintiff was treated the same as the Trans-load employees in that he worked the same hours, took breaks at times so designated by Transload, and received instructions from Transload as to how particular work was to be performed. Furthermore, plaintiff impliedly consented to the borrowed employment relationship by accepting the employment assignment with Transload, as well as its control and direction of his work activities.

Kraus reminded decedent that under his will everything would go to plaintiff and suggested that decedent might want to change his will. In September 1980, Kraus had. another conversation with decedent during which Kraus asked decedent whether he should draw up a new will, to which decedent replied that he wanted to keep the will that he had.

Plaintiff objected to testimony about the change of insurance beneficiary on the basis of relevancy. The trial court permitted the witness to answer, reserving ruling on its relevancy to see if defendant could later tie up intent to change the insurance beneficiary with intent to revoke the will. Usala said decedent told her that plaintiff was named as receiver of decedent’s estate under the will and that Dr. Kuehner and Mrs. Maniglia were the witnesses. Decedent told her that he wanted the beneficiary on the will changed because he felt his parents should get any money that was left after he died because they helped him with his financial responsibilities and with their emotional support. She testified that decedent said he wanted to change the will and the insurance so that any money left after his medical bills were paid went to his parents. During that November 1980 conversation, decedent was depressed, lonesome, and hurt because his relationship with plaintiff had ended, and he felt since plaintiff wanted the relationship ended, he should not leave her as beneficlary under his insurance or his will.\\nIn February or March 1981, Usala had another conversation with decedent at his apartment during which decedent said he wanted to change the will so that his parents would get the money after all the medical bills were paid. Usala said she never saw the will until after decedent died, when defendant showed it to her while he and his wife were cleaning decedent’s apartment. She noted that the will was in the same condition then as it was on the day of trial in that it was ripped on the bottom part.

The decision date is (1984-11-28)\\n\\nCommenting on the relevancy of the evidence concerning change of insurance beneficiary, the trial court at the close of trial made no definite ruling on the admission of this evidence except to state that “[tjhere is no jury here, so it doesn’t make that much difference really.” The court asked the parties to submit post-trial memoranda on the evidence, which also apparently included the relevancy question as it was addressed briefly in the memoranda filed by the parties. Subsequently, the trial court issued a memorandum to the parties in which it found that the facts of Stefany v. Synek (1965), 55 Ill. App. 2d 464, 205 N.E.2d 265, were nearly identical to those of the instant case; that defendant discovered the will in its mutilated condition months before decedent’s death but never informed anyone of the discovery until after decedent died; that decedent had been instructed as to how to revoke the will, and the mere tearing of the attestation clause was contrary to those instructions; that decedent was expressly asked if he wished to change his will, but he stated he did not want to change it; that, based on these observations, it appeared that possession of the will was in defendant at the time of death; that the conditions for revocation of a will were not present; and admitted the will to probate. The court did not comment or rule on the relevancy of the change of life insurance beneficiary.',\n",

The decision date is (1984-11-28)\\n\\nDefendant first contends that the will was improperly admitted to probate because plaintiff failed to present evidence to overcome the presumption of revocation which, he claims, was established by the cutting of the second page and by decedent’s exclusive possession of the will. Generally, where a will remains in the testator’s possession until his death and is then found among his papers with erasures, alterations, cancellations or tearings, the presumption is that such act, manifest upon the will, was done by the testator with the intention of revoking it. (In re Will of Barrie (1946), 393 Ill. 111, 119, 65 N.E.2d 433; Burton v. Wylde (1913), 261 Ill. 397, 399-400, 103 N.E. 976.) No act of tearing or cutting is effective, however, unless there is an intent to revoke the will. (In re Estate of Bakhaus (1951), 410 Ill. 578, 583, 102 N.E.2d 818; Fleming v. Fleming (1937), 367 Ill. 97, 101, 10 N.E.2d 641.) The intent may be inferred from the nature of the act, the condition of the instrument, or by extrinsic evidence, but it must, in some competent way, be made to appear. Fleming v. Fleming (1937), 367 Ill. 97, 101,10 N.E.2d 641.\\nThe Probate Act outlines the methods of revocation of wills.\\n“A will may be revoked only (1) by burning, cancelling, tearing or obliterating it by the testator himself or by some person in his presence and by his direction and consent, (2) by the execution of a later will declaring the revocation, (3) by a later will to the extent that it is inconsistent with the prior will or (4) by the execution of an instrument declaring the revocation and signed and attested in the manner prescribed by this Article for the signing and attestation of a will.” (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 110½, par. 4 — 7(a).)',\n",

Fleming (1937), 367 Ill. 97, 100, 10 N.E.2d 641; Burton v. Wylde (1913), 261 Ill. 397, 402, 103 N.E. 976.) The excision of the names of the attesting witnesses constitutes a tearing within the meaning of the statute (see Stefany v. Synek (1965), 55 Ill. App. 2d 464, 472, 205 N.E.2d 265), and thus the first requirement for the establishment of the presumption has been met.\\nThe trial court held that the second requirement, that decedent have possession and control of the will at the time of his death, had not been met, finding that defendant had possession at the time of decedent’s death. “[W]ith respect to revocation by mutilation, the possession in the testator at the time of death should be such as to carry assurance that the testator’s intention will not be thwarted by the ease with which a will can be mutilated or destroyed; that is to say, that the testator had such possession as does not normally admit of access or opportunity by others to mutilate or destroy.” Stefany v.

The decision date is (1984-11-28)\\n\\nWhat is necessary to show possession turns on the facts of each case. In In re Estate of Bakhaus (1951), 410 Ill. 578, 102 N.E.2d 818, where the will had been kept in a drawer in testator’s harness shop with other business papers, while his other valuable papers were in a safe in his bedroom closet, it was held that the will was in the exclusive possession of the testator. Likewise, in In re Estate of Riner (1965), 59 Ill. App. 2d 434, 207 N.E.2d 487, on which defendant principally relies, where the will, along with business papers, had been kept in a drawer in a house testator shared with his niece and had been found there in a torn condition by the niece and an acquaintance following testator’s death, the court found the presumption of revocation was raised. In contrast, in Stefany v. Synek (1965), 55 Ill. App. 2d 464, 205 N.E.2d 265, the facts of which the trial court found nearly identical to those of the instant case, decedent was hospitalized and her nephew and his wife found a will, which had the names of the attesting witnesses torn off, while cleaning decedent’s home. They took it home, read it, took it to a lawyer, and returned it to where it had been found without telling decedent. Decedent died in a convalescent home, never returning to her home. The appellate court found that under these circumstances, the nephew, rather than decedent, had possession of the will. 55 Ill. App. 2d 464, 472, 205 N.E.2d 265.',\n",

The decision date is (1984-11-28)\\n\\nTurning to the facts of the instant case, we note first that the will was located on top of decedent’s desk after his death, while his other important papers were kept in a metal cabinet. Decedent’s father, who stood to gain if the will was revoked, had access to decedent’s apartment during the month-long hospitalization immediately before decedent’s death. Dr. Usala, a friend and co-worker, also had a key to the apartment. Defendant admitted staying periodically in decedent’s apartment while decedent was in the hospital during that time frame, and decedent never again returned to his apartment. Defendant was the only person to testify to seeing, prior to decedent’s death, the second page of the will in its mutilated condition. Defendant further testified that he saw the will lying on top of the desk on several occasions during the February-March 1981 period while he was at decedent’s apartment.\\nUnder these particular circumstances, we do not believe possession of control of the will was in the decedent-testator until his death to the exclusion of someone who may have an interest in the revocation of the will. Defendant, who stood to gain by mutilation of the will, and who periodically stayed in decedent’s apartment during the month-long time decedent was in the hospital immediately prior to his death, had such access or opportunity to mutilate the will while it was lying in plain view on the desk top that possession of the will was not in the decedent to order to invoke the presumption of revocation of the will. Based on this evidence, we do not believe the trial court’s conclusion that the will was not in decedent’s possession was erroneous.',\n",

The decision date is (1984-11-28)\\n\\nDefendant next argues that even if the presumption of revocation is inapplicable, the trial court’s ruling that the will was not revoked was against the manifest weight of the evidence. A review of the evidence discloses that although the attorney who drafted the will told decedent that the proper way to revoke the will was to burn or tear it completely, the will was found, contrary to those instructions, with the names of the attesting witnesses cut off. The attorney had on two occasions reminded decedent that the will left almost everything to plaintiff and asked decedent if, because the engagement had been broken, he wanted the attorney to draw up a new will, but decedent replied that he wanted to keep the will that he had because plaintiff was still a very good friend and had taken care of him for several years while he was sick. Plaintiff remained in close contact with decedent until his death, calling him five times a week and visiting him once a month. Evidence which shows the testator maintained an attitude of friendship toward proponents of the will up to the time of his death has been held to reflect the attitude of a testator which makes it unlikely that he would have revoked a will benefiting those with whom he continued to have good relations. (See In re Estate of Moos (1953), 414 Ill. 54, 60-61, 110 N.E.2d 194; In re Estate of Babcock (1983), 119 Ill. App. 3d 482, 489-90, 456 N.E.2d 671, appeal allowed (1984), 96 Ill. 2d 567 (cases which deal with the presumption of revocation where the will cannot be found).) While it is evident that decedent expressed thoughts about changing his will and its presence on top of his desk indicates such, it is also shown that decedent told his attorney that he wanted to keep the present will and remained a good friend of plaintiff.',\n",

The decision date is (1984-11-28)\\n\\nSome of the testimony was conflicting, in that while defendant testified that he saw the will with the second page cut between January 10, 1981, and February 11, 1981, Dr. Usala stated that in a February or March 1981 conversation, decedent told her he wanted to change the will, implying that he had not as yet done so. Defendant stated that he found the will the day after decedent’s death, in the presence of his other son, David, and, because he believed things should not be left in an unattended apartment, took it, along with other important papers, back to Michigan. Dr. Usala testified that she saw the will in decedent’s apartment a week or two after his death when decedent’s parents were cleaning his apartment, so that there is a conflict in testimony as to when the will was actually discovered and removed. We recognize that, especially where the testimony is contradictory, the trial judge as trier of fact is in a position superior to a court of review to observe the conduct of the witnesses while testifying, to determine their credibility, and to weigh the evidence, and where, as here, we believe the trial court’s finding is not against the manifest weight of the evidence, we will not disturb it.

Johnson (1983), 98 Ill. 2d 166, 173-74, 456 N.E.2d 120.\\nDefendant claims that because the attestation signatures had been cut off, plaintiff attempted to prove the will by testimony, pursuant to section 6 — 4 of the Probate Act of 1975 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 110½, par. 6 — 4), but that the testimony failed because the attesting witnesses were unable to identify specifically the will.

The decision date is (1984-11-28)\\n\\n“When each of 2 attesting witnesses to a will states that (1) he was present and saw the testator or some person in his presence and by his direction sign the will in the presence of the witness or the testator acknowledged it to the witness as his act, (2) the will was attested by the witness in the presence of the testator and (3) he believed the testator to be of sound mind and memory at the time of signing or acknowledging the will, the execution of the will is sufficiently proved to admit it to probate, unless there is proof of fraud, forgery, compulsion or other improper conduct which in the opinion of the court is deemed sufficient to invalidate or destroy the will.” (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 110½, par. 6 — 4(a).)\\nBoth witnesses to the will sought to be admitted attested to decedent’s sound mind and memory and stated that they saw decedent sign the will and that they signed the will, thus fulfilling the statutory requirements. Dr. Kuehner recognized that the date on the will was in his handwriting, and he and Mrs. Maniglia each testified that they saw the other sign it. Dr. Usala testified that decedent told her that Kuehner and Maniglia were witnesses to the will and plaintiff was the beneficiary. Attorney Gary Kraus identified the will as the one he drafted for decedent, except that the signature lines on the attestation clause had been cut off. Thus, the requirements of the statute regarding execution of the will were met, and the proofs were sufficient to show that the will sought to be admitted was the will attested to by the witnesses. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the trial court properly admitted the will to probate even though the witnesses to it could not definitely identify it as the will decedent signed.',\n",

The decision date is (1984-11-28)\\n\\nDefendant’s next contention is that the trial court, relying on the Dead Man’s Act, improperly prohibited defendant, as a party in interest, from testifying as to a conversation he had with decedent regarding the will. Defendant maintains that the Act was inapplicable because the testimony would have been such that decedent could not refute it and because plaintiff had “opened the door” by calling defendant as an adverse witness.\\nThe Dead Man’s Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 110, par. 8 — 201) renders incompetent the testimony from an interested person concerning conversations and events taking place in the presence of the deceased person. (Manning v. Mock (1983), 119 Ill. App. 3d 788, 800, 457 N.E.2d 447.) Defendant argues that decedent evidenced an intent to revoke, based on the change of beneficiary on his life insurance policies, which decedent, if alive, could not refute. However, decedent, if alive, obviously could refute that he had intended to revoke the will, a question separate from the change of beneficiary on his life insurance policies.\\nAlthough defendant had been called by plaintiff as an adverse witness, the conversation about which defendant wished to testify was not a subject opened up by plaintiff during her section 2 — 1102 examination. Defendant claims all of his testimony was “part of the same transaction,” so as to fall within an exception to the Dead Man’s Act which provides:\\n“If any person testifies on behalf of the representative to any conversation with the deceased or person under legal disability or to any event which took place in the presence of the deceased or person under legal disability, any adverse party or interested person, if otherwise competent, may testify concerning the same conversation or event.” (Ill.

The decision date is (1984-11-28)\\n\\nThe words “same conversation or event,” when given their plain and ordinary meaning (see Schutzenhofer v. Granite City Steel Co. (1982), 93 Ill. 2d 208, 211-12, 443 N.E.2d 563), are not as encompassing as defendant contends, for, under his interpretation, any fact regarding the will would be subject to the exception to the Act. (See Manning v. Mock (1983), 119 Ill. App. 3d 788, 799, 457 N.E.2d 447.) Defendant was examined pursuant to section 2 — 1102 only generally as to the dates of decedent’s hospitalization, the defendant’s access to decedent’s apartment, and defendant’s showing of the will to plaintiff at the funeral. Although a party who is incompetent to testify for himself as to a transaction, if called as an adverse witness and questioned concerning the same, is competent to testify on his own behalf as to the whole of the transaction, the incompetency is not removed on other matters about which he was not interrogated by the adverse party. (Perkins v. Brown (1948), 400 Ill. 490, 497, 81 N.E.2d 207.) Here, the disputed conversation sought to be introduced clearly does not fall within the exception to the Dead Man’s Act and was properly excluded.\\nDefendant next contends that the trial court erred in disallowing relevant evidence pertaining to the decedent’s change of beneficiary in certain life insurance policies, which comprised most of his estate, from plaintiff to his estate. From our examination of the court’s comments on this point, it is not entirely clear whether the court excluded all of this evidence or just the change-of-beneficiary card sought to be introduced into evidence. The court below commented at one point that, as this was not a jury trial, admission of this evidence did not make that much difference. Thus, it would appear that the trial court considered at least part of this type of evidence, but gave little weight to the evidence.',\n",

The change of beneficiary on the life insurance policies was made to be consistent with that of his estate. The plaintiff was the beneficiary of the estate under the will. While it is apparent from some of the evidence that decedent expressed thoughts about changing his will, other evidence, as discussed above, was that he wanted to keep the will that he had attorney Kraus prepare. Had decedent wished to exclude plaintiff from the bulk of his estate, which was the insurance proceeds, he could have made his parents the beneficiaries when he, instead, made the estate the beneficiary. The most the change of beneficiary evidence shows is that decedent during his terminal illness was concerned with who would be the beneficiary of his estate.

The decision date is (2007-02-08)\\n\\nPRESIDING JUSTICE QUINN\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nPlaintiff Carolyn Phillips appeals from the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County granting summary judgment for defendants Budget Rent-A-Car Systems, Inc. (Budget), and Ranger Security (Ranger). In addition, she appeals the circuit court’s denial of her motion for reconsideration of summary judgment in favor of Budget. For the following reasons, we affirm.\\nBACKGROUND\\nThis case arises from an automobile accident that occurred on July 2, 1997. The accident resulted from a high-speed police chase during which an unidentified driver of a stolen Budget rental vehicle collided with plaintiffs vehicle as the driver fled from police. Plaintiff suffered multiple injuries as a result of the vehicular collision.\\nThe procedural history of this case shows that plaintiff filed an initial suit on August 15, 1997, and filed an amended complaint on August 24,1998. Thereafter, on May 19, 2000, the circuit court granted plaintiffs motion to voluntarily dismiss the initial action and dismissed plaintiffs case without prejudice.\\nOn May 18, 2001, plaintiff filed the current action. In her complaint, plaintiff alleged two counts of negligence against Budget and one count of negligence against Ranger. Specifically, plaintiff alleged that Budget breached its duty to maintain control over its vehicle so as to prevent harm to persons lawfully on public streets, and that Budget and Ranger breached their duties to prevent unauthorized personnel access to that vehicle so as to prevent harm to members of the general public. Budget filed its answer on July 26, 2001, and Ranger filed its answer on September 7, 2001.',\n",

With permission of the court, plaintiff conducted further discovery and on December 21, 2004, filed a response to Budget’s motion. Therein, she stated that special circumstances, specifically that Budget had gone to great lengths to prevent vehicular thefts by hiring a security company and installing “tiger teeth,” existed to make the accident foreseeable.\\nDuring discovery, Budget disclosed that to facilitate the movement of its vehicles, it kept the keys of its vehicles in the vehicles’ ignitions. Budget also employed “hikers” to transport rental vehicles between facilities to maintain proper inventory. Hikers moved 200 to 250 vehicles per day among Budget facilities. When demand for vehicles at locations was great, Budget would have other employees such as service agents, mechanics, and bus drivers act as hikers.\\nIn order to transport a vehicle from the O’Hare facility to another facility, a hiker needed to show a nonrevenue transport ticket (NRT) to Ranger security before exiting the facility. The on-duty manager or other distribution personnel provided the hiker with blank NRTs and would instruct him to select a particular class of vehicle to transport. The hiker would then record the vehicle’s identification information on the NRT, including the vehicle identification number, license plate number, vehicle’s owning city, and the sending and destination cities. The hiker would also record his identification number and the vehicle’s milage before signing the NRT.',\n",

The decision date is (2007-02-08)\\n\\nPursuant to the security guard agreement, the primary responsibility of Ranger was “to [ensure] that no vehicles are taken from the facility without the proper authorizations.” The agreement procedures specifically provided that a Ranger guard could permit a service agent or customer service representative to remove a vehicle not on a rental contract from the Budget facility only if the driver presented an NRT signed by a Budget manager. The security guard was then to cross-reference the signature with a list of names that Budget was to provide the guards and to make sure the correct date was on the NRT. The guard kept a copy of the NRT. The parties agree, however, that Budget never provided Ranger personnel with a list of names of Budget managers who could authorize an NRT.\\nThat said, the agreed facts in this case show that about 5:37 a.m. on June 24, 1997, an unidentified driver of a Budget 1997 Ford Explorer presented an NRT signed by James Dawson, a courtesy bus driver and service agent stationed at the Budget O’Hare facility, and initialed by Les Holiday, a lead hiker, to a Ranger guard. Although the NRT had the correct sending and receiving locations listed, it had erroneous vehicle mileage, where it listed 13,467 miles while Budget computer data showed 7,490 miles, an improper date, where it was marked June 24, 1996, instead of June 24, 1997, and the wrong identification number for Dawson. Despite those errors, the Ranger guard permitted the unidentified driver to exit the facility with the vehicle.\\nSubsequently, around June 30, 1997, Budget’s Midway Airport facility manager Rica Hernandez received an inactive report alerting her that the Midway facility never received the 1997 Ford Explorer. After investigating the matter, Hernandez prepared a “Missing Vehicle Report” and faxed it to Daniel Martin, Budget’s security manager, on June 30, 1997. Martin, who had been on vacation, reviewed the fax on July 1, 1997.',\n",

When he questioned Dawson as to his alleged signature on the NRT used to remove the missing Ford Explorer, Dawson denied that the signature was his. Dawson’s supervisor, Bryant Small, confirmed that the signature on the NET was not Dawson’s. Subsequently, Martin reported the vehicle stolen to the Chicago police department. Budget also notified LoJack, which electronically monitored Budget vehicle movements through its vehicle tracking system.\\nOn July 2, 1997, LoJack located the stolen Ford Explorer at 6750 South Normal Boulevard in Chicago, which was approximately 26 miles from the Budget O’Hare facility. Police found the vehicle, and after observing an unidentified individual enter it, they attempted to stop him. A high-speed police chase ensued during which the stolen Ford Explorer hit plaintiff, who was walking across the intersection at 69th Street and Halsted Street. The driver of the stolen vehicle fled on foot and was never arrested or identified. Plaintiff suffered a fractured pelvis, a broken left arm and leg, and several head injuries.\\nBased on the pleadings and this record, the circuit court granted Budget’s motion for summary judgment on January 21, 2005. The circuit court also denied plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration on August 16, 2005.\\nOn February 17, 2005, Ranger also filed a motion for summary judgment.

The decision date is (2007-02-08)\\n\\nPlaintiff appeals from those orders granting summary judgment.\\nANALYSIS\\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists. Adams v. Northern Illinois Gas Co., 211 Ill. 2d 32, 42-43 (2004). Summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings, affidavits, depositions, admissions, and exhibits on file, when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, reveal that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the nonmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Adams, 211 Ill. 2d at 43, citing 735 ILCS 5/2—1005(c) (West 2004). In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, all evidence before the court considering summary judgment should be construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Adams, 211 Ill. 2d at 43. Since summary judgment is a drastic remedy, it should only be granted when the right of the movant is clear and free from doubt. Adams, 211 Ill. 2d at 43. A review of a circuit court’s grant of summary judgment is de novo. Adams, 211 Ill. 2d at 43.\\nIn the case at bar, plaintiff alleged claims of negligence against both defendants. To prevail, plaintiff had to show that each defendant owed her a duty of care, that defendants breached their duties of care, and that plaintiff incurred injuries proximately caused by those breaches. Adams, 211 Ill. 2d at 43. The primary issue here is whether defendants, Budget and Ranger Security, owed plaintiff a duty of care. Since the question of whether a duty of care exists is a question of law (Adams, 211 Ill. 2d at 43), it constituted a proper issue for summary judgment.',\n",

The decision date is (2007-02-08)\\n\\nIn this court, plaintiff challenges the circuit court’s order granting summary judgment for defendants by asserting that Budget owed a duty to prevent the accident in this case where it left the keys in the ignition of the unattended vehicle. Plaintiff further asserts that Ranger breached its duty to prevent the accident where it failed to take the necessary precautions to prevent the stolen vehicle from leaving Budget’s facility.\\nWe first address the issue of whether Budget owed plaintiff a duty of care. In doing so, we recognize that plaintiff’s claims against Budget are premised on the ‘‘key in the ignition” theory due to Budget’s ownership of the stolen Ford Explorer. Illinois courts have recognized two classes of cases involving the duty of a vehicle owner to lock his vehicle and to remove the keys from the ignition after parking the vehicle.\\nThe first class of cases involves a defendant’s statutory violation. In Ney v. Yellow Cab Co., 2 Ill. 2d 74 (1954), the defendant’s servant, a taxicab driver, left his taxicab unattended on the street with the keys in the ignition. He thereby violated a statute which provided in pertinent part that a driver was prohibited from leaving his vehicle unattended without first turning off the engine, locking the ignition, and removing the key. A thief thereafter stole the taxicab and, while in flight, collided with the plaintiffs vehicle. Our supreme court noted that the defendant’s violation of the statute constituted prima facie evidence of negligence. Ney, 2 Ill. 2d at 78-79. The court further found that an intervening act, even one that was criminal in nature, did not relieve the defendant of liability from the consequences resulting from the taxicab driver’s negligence. Ney, 2 Ill. 2d at 83-84.',\n",

App. 2d 27 (1965), violated the same statute as in Ney where it had a practice of leaving its vehicles parked on a public street with the keys in the ignitions. Subsequently, thieves stole one of the defendant’s vehicles, and the stolen vehicle was involved in an accident with the plaintiff a day later. The plaintiff filed suit against the dealer, and the circuit court entered judgment for the plaintiff.\\nOn appeal, this court, like the supreme court in Ney, stated that a statutory violation was prima facie evidence of negligence. Kacena, 63 Ill. App. 2d at 33. Further, despite the remoteness in time and distance of the accident from the defendant dealer, this court found that a question of fact existed as to probable cause and thus affirmed the circuit court’s ruling denying the defendant’s motions for a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Kacena, 63 Ill. App. 2d at 39.\\nIn both Ney and Kacena, the defendants’ vehicles were stolen while parked on public property in violation of a state statute. In analyzing the liability of the defendants, the courts determined that the statutory violations were prima facie evidence of negligence and thus confined their discussion to the existence of proximate cause. As noted in Ruyle v. Reynolds, 43 Ill. App. 3d 905, 907 (1976), the rule in Ney, and consequently Kacena, and the statute therein have been limited to cases involving public streets.',\n",

In this second class of cases, Illinois courts have held that no duty exists to a third party injured by the defendant’s stolen vehicle absent special circumstances that made the theft foreseeable. Hallmark Insurance Co. v. Chicago Transit Authority, 179 Ill. App. 3d 260 (1989); Hensler v. Renn, 166 Ill. App. 3d 819 (1988); Ruyle v. Reynolds, 43 Ill. App. 3d 905 (1976).\\nIn Reynolds, the defendant’s agent left his vehicle unlocked and unattended with the keys in the ignition in a parking lot. The vehicle was subsequently stolen and involved in an accident with the plaintiffs vehicle. Although the circuit court dismissed the plaintiffs complaint, the reviewing court reversed that dismissal where it determined that the plaintiffs complaint stated a sufficient claim. The appellate court found that plaintiff stated a valid claim based on the defendant’s violation of a city ordinance prohibiting a person from leaving a vehicle unattended with keys in the ignition in a “public place” (Reynolds, 43 Ill. App. 3d at 907-09), as well as a valid claim under the common law theory of negligence (Reynolds, 43 Ill. App. 3d at 909). In discussing the common law claim, the court noted that given the neighborhood in which the defendant’s agent left the vehicle unattended, it was foreseeable that a theft would occur. Reynolds, 43 Ill. App. 3d at 909. As such, the reviewing court held that the plaintiff sufficiently alleged special circumstances which made the theft foreseeable and that the issue of proximate cause was for a jury to decide. Reynolds, 43 Ill. App. 3d at 909. Thus, it reversed the lower court’s motion to dismiss. Reynolds, 43 Ill. App. 3d at 909.',\n",

The thief subsequently drove the bus into a building owned by the plaintiffs, who alleged that the defendant left the bus unattended without first turning off the engine and removing the keys from the ignition. After the plaintiff filed suit, the defendant filed for summary judgment without filing any pleading or answering the plaintiff’s complaint. This court reversed the circuit court’s order granting summary judgment for the defendant where it determined that special circumstances existed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the defendant’s duty. Hallmark Insurance Co., 179 Ill. App. 3d at 267. In finding that special circumstances existed, this court determined that plaintiffs uncontested claim that defendant knew of prior thefts stated a sufficient claim.

Consequently, this case falls within the second class of Illinois cases involving keys left in the ignition of unattended vehicles. Plaintiff, however, merely alleged that Budget was negligent for failing to restrict access to its vehicles and in its administration of its NET process without alleging any special circumstances, i.e., previous vehicular thefts at the O’Hare Budget facility. Although plaintiff referenced special circumstances in her response to Budget’s motion for summary judgment and asserted therein that Budget took security precautions, she made none of the special circumstance arguments in the circuit court that she proffers in her briefs before this court. As such, those arguments are waived. Daniels v. Anderson, 162 Ill. 2d 47, 56-58 (1994)..\\nNonetheless, even if we considered plaintiffs allegations of special circumstances, we find that she failed to establish that Budget owed her a duty to prevent the theft of its vehicle and the ensuing police chase which ultimately led to a collision in which plaintiff sustained multiples injuries. Unlike Reynolds and Hallmark Insurance Co., upon which plaintiff relies, she failed to sufficiently state facts establishing special circumstances that made the theft foreseeable.

A thief then stole the vehicle and collided with the plaintiffs vehicle as he drove away. The reviewing court affirmed the circuit court’s order granting the defendant’s motion for summary judgment where it determined that the plaintiff failed to establish the existence of special circumstances to sustain a common law negligence claim against the defendant where plaintiff merely claimed that the defendant left the vehicle unattended in a high-crime area. Renn, 166 Ill. App. 3d at 824. In doing so, the court stated that it was unwilling to extend the ruling in Reynolds to find a duty on the defendant’s behalf absent additional allegations showing that a theft was likely to occur where the public place in which defendant parked his vehicle was a heavy traffic area. Renn, 166 Ill. App. 3d at 824.\\nHere, plaintiff argues before this court that special circumstances existed in the case at bar that made the theft of Budget’s vehicle foreseeable by asserting that Budget employees spend 200 days a year in court litigating criminal activity involving their vehicles, that Martin testified in his deposition that five previous police chases had occurred following the theft of Budget vehicles, and that three of those chases resulted in accidents. That said, plaintiff fails to assert whether those past thefts occurred at the Budget O’Hare facility and within what time frame. Further, plaintiff cites only one other instance in which a forged NRT was used to steal a vehicle from a Budget facility. As such, as in Renn, we find that plaintiff fails to establish special circumstances that made the theft in this case reasonably foreseeable, and thus she fails to establish that Budget owed her a duty of care.',\n",

The decision date is (2007-02-08)\\n\\nMoreover, foreseeability is only one factor for a court to consider when it seeks to determine whether a duty of care exists. Duty also depends on the likelihood of injury, the magnitude of the burden on a defendant to prevent an injury, and the consequences of placing such a burden on a defendant. Adams, 211 Ill. 2d at 44; Rowe v. State Bank of Lombard, 125 Ill. 2d 203, 227-28 (1988). The cases cited above involving keys left in the ignitions of vehicles, whether on public or private property, focused on foreseeability and bypassed important public policy questions.\\nHere, an unknown individual was able to forge an NRT and remove a vehicle from Budget’s lot, which the record reveals has only happened on one other occasion. Although Budget was arguably negligent in the administration of its security measures to protect against vehicular thefts, we do not find that those errors created a duty of care to plaintiff with regard to an accident involving Budget’s stolen vehicle. To conclude otherwise would place a significant burden on Budget and would expose all rental car companies to third-party criminal liability involving their vehicles. We do not find such a broad duty of care to the general public to be a prudent or reasonable holding. As such, we find that summary judgment was appropriate for Budget.\\nHaving reached that conclusion, we next address the issue of whether Ranger owed plaintiff a duty of care. Plaintiff contends that by entering into a contract with Budget, Ranger “undertook to perform a duty that Budget owed to the public in this area to protect against the streets being filled with thieves operating its stolen rental cars.” The basis of plaintiff’s argument is section 324A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which provides:',\n",

For support, plaintiff relies upon Pippin v. Chicago Housing Authority, 78 Ill. 2d 204 (1979).\\nIn Pippin, a mother brought an action against the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) and Interstate Service Corporation (Interstate) for the wrongful death of her son, who was allegedly stabbed by a tenant during an argument within the common area of the CHA’s building. The record showed that the CHA entered into a contract with Interstate to provide for the protection of CHA’s property and “persons thereon.” Our supreme court held that, given the contract, Interstate owed Pippin a duty of care pursuant to section 324A(c). Pippin, 78 Ill. 2d at 210-12. The supreme court thus affirmed this court’s ruling reversing the circuit court’s grant of summary judgment for defendants. Pippin, 78 Ill. 2d at 212.',\n",

The decision date is (2007-02-08)\\n\\nUnlike Pippin, however, the contract between Budget and Ranger did not appear to provide for the protection of third parties. Rather, as previously stated, the contract merely provided that Ranger was to ensure that “no vehicles are taken from the facility without proper authorizations.” This language arguably only pertained to Budget’s property, not the protection of unforeseen third parties, and thus did not create a duty of care to plaintiff. See Bourgonje v. Machev, 362 Ill. App. 3d 984, 1003 (2005) (“In those cases where the agreements specified that the guards were intended to protect the tenants, liability attached; but, where it was specified that the guards’ function was only to protect property, no liability attached”).\\nNonetheless, even if we accepted plaintiff’s argument that the contractual language could create a duty to an innocent third party, we find that plaintiffs reliance on Pippin seeks to expand the concept of foreseeability beyond that found in Pippin. Unlike in Pippin, the criminal action in this case did not occur on the premises Ranger was hired to protect but rather resulted from the criminal use of Budget property outside the Budget premises. Furthermore, as discussed above, the accident in this case resulted from a forged NRT, which allegedly occurred in only one other circumstance. Accordingly, we find that the accident in this case was not foreseeable, and thus Ranger owed plaintiff no duty of care.',\n",

The decision date is (2007-02-08)\\n\\nIn reaching these conclusions, we further find that even if a genuine issue of material fact had existed as to defendants’ duties of care, summary judgment was appropriate in the case at bar due to lack of proximate cause. Although proximate cause is ordinarily a question of fact for the trier of fact to resolve, our supreme court has noted that it is well settled that it may be determined as a matter of law where the facts presented show that plaintiff would never recover as a matter of law. Abrams v. City of Chicago, 211 Ill. 2d 251, 257-58 (2004).\\nProximate cause consists of two distinct requirements: cause in fact and legal cause. Abrams, 211 Ill. 2d at 258. Cause in fact concerns whether the defendant’s conduct is a material factor in bringing about the injury if the injury would not have occurred absent the defendant’s conduct. Abrams, 211 Ill. 2d at 258. Legal cause consists largely of a question of foreseeability. Abrams, 211 Ill. 2d at 258.\\nIn Abrams, the plaintiff, a pregnant mother in labor, called the City’s 911 service to request ambulance services. The City’s 911 dispatcher declined to send an ambulance, however, due to her classification of the plaintiff’s situation as not being an emergency. Subsequently, the plaintiffs friend drove her to the hospital. During that transport, the plaintiffs friend attempted to drive through a red light when she did not see any traffic. As she entered the intersection, however, another vehicle, which was speeding at the time, collided with her vehicle. The driver of the second vehicle later admitted in a handwritten statement to police that he was driving on a suspended license and that he had a beer, two shots of rum, and crack cocaine before getting behind the wheel of his vehicle. As a result of the accident, plaintiff suffered in a coma for two weeks and lost her baby. Thereafter, plaintiff sued the City of Chicago for the negligent failure to provide ambulance services.',\n",

The decision date is (2007-02-08)\\n\\nOur supreme court reversed the ruling of this court and reinstated the circuit court’s judgment granting the City of Chicago summary judgment in Abrams after determining that, based on the alleged facts, the plaintiff could not establish that the City’s refusal to send an ambulance was the proximate cause of her injuries. Abrams, 211 Ill. 2d at 264. Specifically, the court held that the City’s refusal was not the legal cause of the plaintiffs injuries because it could not have reasonably anticipated that its refusal to send the ambulance would result in the plaintiffs friend driving through a red light and colliding with another vehicle driven by a substance-impaired driver. Abrams, 211 Ill. 2d at 261-62.\\nThe record here shows that only one other alleged incident involving an NRT had resulted in the theft of a vehicle from a Budget facility. As such, defendants could not have reasonably foreseen that the accident in this case would result from their decision to leave the keys in the ignition of the 1997 Ford Explorer and the subsequent release of the vehicle pursuant to a forged NRT.\\nMoreover, the accident in the case at bar occurred eight days after the theft and 26 miles from the Budget O’Hare facility. In Stanko v. Zilien, 33 Ill. App. 2d 364 (1961), a case similar to the one at bar, the defendant, a used automobile dealer, left the keys of its vehicles in the keys of their ignition during business hours while the vehicles were parked on the defendant’s private lot. Consequently, a thief substituted the keys of one of defendant’s vehicles during the day and returned at night to steal the vehicle. Twelve days later and forty-one and a half blocks away from defendant’s place of business, the stolen vehicle driven by the thief struck the plaintiffs vehicle. On appeal, this court upheld the circuit court’s grant of summary judgment. In reaching that holding, this court stated:',\n",

The failure to make defence as to the interest affected by the foreclosure,—i. e., that which defendant in error obtained by the master’s deed under the decree foreclosing the mortgage of William Goodrich to Laura Ann Goodrich,—can, upon no principle that we are aware of, be held to preclude the defendant in error from obtaining title to the whole of the property at the master’s sale under the decree for partition. The interests are totally distinct and independent of each other. Randolph was a party to the decree for partition, as the record shows, and he is, therefore, bound by it. Defendant in error was not a party to that decree, and he is, therefore, affected by no mere irregularity not going to the question of jurisdiction. There was jurisdiction of the persons and of the subject matter of the suit, and there was a decree of sale, and this was sufficient to protect defendant in error, whether the prior decree for partition was rendered or not.

The statute expressly provides that “a person having a mortgage, attachment or other lien on the share of. a part owner, shall be concluded by the judgment in partition, so far as it respects the partition and the assignment of the shares, but his lien shall remain in full force upon. the part assigned to or left for such part owner.” (Rev.

Stat. 1874, chap. 106, sec. 31, p. 752.) And, besides this, by section 39, power is also given the court “to investigate and determine, in suits for the partition of real estate, all questions of conflicting or controverted titles,” etc. Where, therefore,; a sale was decreed, it was competent for the court to investigate the claim made by the plaintiff in error, and that made by .the defendant in error, to three-sevenths of the proceeds; and this the court proceeded to-do.

His last employment was for about one year. It appears from the evidence that the alleged accident occurred on or about September 10, 1915. While the deceased was pushing a truck loaded with boxes and cases he slipped and fell and some of the cases fell upon him, striking him in the region of the back and hip. It appears that he left the employment of the plaintiff in error about four weeks after the injury. For a time after that he was able to be about and walk with the aid of a cane and had some medical treatment. On December 27 following he was taken to the Michael Reese Hospital, where upon examination his hip was found to be infected with incipient tuberculosis and an operation was performed for the removal of an abscess. On February 24, 1916, a more advanced tubercular hip condition was found. Thereafter it was discovered that his lungs were tubercular. About May of the same year he was taken to the Cook County Hospital and died the following August of pulmonary tuberculosis. Application for the adjustment of this claim was filed February 25, 1916. The testimony of deceased was taken in the Cook County Hospital on the nth day of May, 1916. Beatrice Kucinski, his widow, was appointed administratrix of his estate and appears as defendant in error here.',\n",

The decision date is (1919-04-15)\\n\\nConcerning the contention of plaintiff in error that no notice of the injury was given, as required by section 24 of the Workmen’s Compensation act, the record shows that the deceased testified concerning the manner of his injury, and that immediately after the injury he told Joe Lukidc, a foreman of plaintiff in error, that he had been injured and how it happened; that he was sent to the company doctor, who examined his hip, applied medicine of some sort and told him that he would be all right by the next day; that he returned to work but that the pain increased for three or four weeks, at the end of which time he told Lukidc that his hip hurt him so much that unless he could get easier work he would have to quit, and that Lukidc told him there was no other job for him and that he should go home and stay there until he was ready to come back. Section 24 of the Workmen’s Compensation act provides, among other things, that notice of the injury shall be given within thirty days, with certain exceptions, and further provides “that the failure on the part of any person entitled to such compensation to give such notice shall not relieve the employer from his liability for such compensation, when the facts and circumstances of such accident are known . to such .employer, his agent or vice-principal in the enterprise.” The commission fo'und that notice of the injury was, in fact, given as required by statute. There is evidence in the record tending to prove that deceased notified Lukidc, who the deceased testified was plaintiff in error’s foreman, of the injury shortly after its occurrence.

Industrial Com. supra. The question decided in that case arose by reason of a contest between the widow and the parents of the deceased as to who was entitled to the compensation, and this court in that case held: “The statute as to distribution of the amount paid by the employer to the personal representative o.f the deceased applies only in cases where the employer voluntarily pays the compensation to the personal representative of the deceased without a hearing and determination before an arbitrator or the Industrial Commission. If the compensation is fixed by the Industrial Commission it is required to determine who is entitled to the compensation before it can • determine the amount. * * * The fact that the claimants were the persons described in paragraphs (a) and (&), under which paragraphs the amount of the compensation provided is the same, could not operate to relieve the Industrial Commission from the duty of determining the person or persons who were entitled to the compensation. We do not construe the statute in such cases as this to leave it to the probate court to determine who is entitled to the award made by the Industrial Commission.” In the case at bar there is no contest as to who shall receive the benefit of the award, and the rule laid down in the Smith-Lohr Coal Co. case on that point has no application here.',\n",

Section 21, as amended in 1915, provides in this regard as follows: “Any fight to receive compensation hereunder shall be extinguished by the death of the person or persons entitled thereto, subject to the provisions of this act relative to compensation for death received in the course of employment: Provided, that upon the death of a beneficiary, who is receiving compensation provided for in section 7, leaving surviving a parent, sister or brother of the deceased employee, at the time of his death dependent upon him for support, who were receiving from such beneficiary a contribution to support, then that proportion of the compensation of the beneficiary which would have been paid but for the death of the beneficiary, but in no event exceeding said unpaid compensation, which the contribution of the beneficiary to the dependent’s support within one year prior to the death of the beneficiary bears to the compensation of the beneficiary within that year, shall be continued for the benefit of such dependents, notwithstanding the death of the beneficiary.”',\n",

The decision date is (1919-04-15)\\n\\nThe proviso in section 21 applies to those cases where the beneficiary receiving compensation provided for in section 7 dies leaving surviving a parent, sister or brother of the deceased employee who was at the time of his death dependent upon the said deceased employee for support and who was receiving from such beneficiary a contribution towards support. In this case the only beneficiaries are the widow and a child, whose compensation is payable under paragraph (a) of section 7. The death of either of these beneficiaries would not leave surviving “a parent, sister or brother of the deceased employee,” hence it follows that the proviso in section 21 has no application to compensation awarded under paragraph (a) of section 7. As we understand paragraphs (a) and (/) of section 7, they do not provide for determination by the Industrial Commission of the proportionate share which each beneficiary is entitled to receive where the beneficiaries are all of the class specified in paragraph (a) of said section, although, as was held in the Smith-Lohr Coal Co. case, the commission must, in order to determine the total amount of compensation, determine who is entitled to receive the same. That case does not, however, hold that it is incumbent upon the commission to determine how much or what proportion of the compensation every member of the class may receive. As was said by this court in the case of Wangler Boiler and Sheet Metal Works Co. v. Industrial Com. 287 Ill. 118: “Compensation under the act in question is analogous to and is' to take the place of damages at common law and under the statute. While the right to compensation is not a subject of bequest of the beneficiary but continues in the dependents of the beneficiary only in the manner provided by said act, yet such right to compensation, when determined according to law, is no less a vested right and one that can be affected only by the act of the legislature that gave it.

(Hansen v. Brann & Stewart Co. 90 N. J. L. 444.) The intention of the legislature to so treat that right is shown by section 9 of the act, which, as we have seen, provides that where a lump-sum settlement is awarded by the Industrial Board in case of an injury resulting in death there is no right of rejection either by the employer or beneficiary. The intention of the legislature that such right, shall be a vested right is further shown by paragraph (g) of section 19 of the act, which provides for judgment in the circuit court on an award where there is a refusal or failure to pay the compensation, such judgment being treated as similar to an execution.—Friedman Manf. Co. v. Industrial Com. 284 Ill. 554.” By paragraph (a) of section 7 the employer becomes liable, at all events, to pay a sum equal to four times the average earnings of the employee, within the limitations there prescribed as to amount, and as we view the provisions of section 21 of the act the legislature did not intend that its provisions regarding reduction of compensation should apply- to cases enumerated in said paragraph. The commission therefore did not err in making the award without determining the amount to which each beneficiary is entitled.',\n",

There is no evidence as to what medical expenses were incurred by the deceased prior to February 24, 1916. The award of the Industrial Commission relative to the amount for medical services is based upon the testimony of Dr. Mueller for his services between the 24th day of February and the first day of April following, in the year 1916. The services were not rendered within eight weeks of the date of the alleged accident, to-wit, September 10, 1915, or within eight weeks of the first day of disability. The deceased was evidently under treatment prior to February 24. The services of Dr. Mueller were rendered at the request of the deceased. Section 80 of the statute in question, relative to medical and hospital services in case of injury not resulting in death, as amended in 1915, is as follows: “The employer shall provide necessary first aid, medical, surgical and hospital services; also medical, surgical and hospital services for a period not longer than eight weeks, not to exceed, however, the amount of $200. The employee may elect to secure his own physician, surgeon or hospital services at his own expense.” There is no evidence in the record tending to show that the deceased requested plaintiff in error to supply medical services, other than the letter of his attorney on February 24, 1916, to plaintiff in error, stating that he assumed that plaintiff in error would assume all obligations of the Workmen’s Compensation act. Plaintiff in error maintains a staff of physicians. The testimony of deceased showed that he was familiar with that fact, yet he chose other medical aid in the treatment he received prior to February 24 and subsequent to the day of the injury, when the evidence shows he went to the company doctor.

The decision date is (1996-02-05)\\n\\nJUSTICE BUCKLEY\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nPlaintiff, Charlene Drayson, filed an action in the circuit court seeking a declaratory judgment that certain conditions and a right to repurchase contained in the deed from defendant, George Wolff, to plaintiff’s predecessor in interest, are illegal restraints on alienation. Plaintiff also requested a judgment that she is entitled to a permanent, \"transferrable” easement across the remaining property of defendant. Upon being served, defendant removed the action to Federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. The district court remanded the case to the circuit court because it found that it did not have jurisdiction due to the lack of a case or controversy between the parties.\\nWhile the case was pending in Federal court, the parties filed motions for summary judgment. After the case was remanded to the circuit court, plaintiff requested a hearing on the summary judgment motions filed in Federal court. After a hearing, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant, finding the terms of the deed to be reasonable restraints on alienation. Plaintiff now appeals the circuit court order.\\nBACKGROUND\\nSince about 1953, defendant’s family owned 30 acres of real property located in Hanover Township, Cook County, Illinois. This property was used as the family residence until October 1980, when defendant severed and sold approximately 4.577 acres of the property. This parcel, on which the home stands, was conveyed to La Salle National Bank as trustee for Carl LoDico. In order to preserve the character of this home and land, defendant conveyed the land subject to conditions subsequent and retained a right to repurchase. He did this with the intention of rejoining this property with the remainder of the original 30 acres at some point in the future.',\n",

The decision date is (1996-02-05)\\n\\nThe deed at issue grants the property subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in \"Exhibit B,” which is attached to the deed. Exhibit B contains a section titled \"Deed Conditions,” which is included in the appendix of this opinion, but will be briefly summarized here. This section restricts the use of the property to only single-family residential purposes for a period of 39 years\\n1\\n. Only one dwelling house of at least 3,000 square feet is permitted on the property and the existing home is to be maintained. The deed is also subject to the condition that all real estate taxes he paid in a timely fashion. The instrument specifically states that the conditions are to be construed as express conditions subsequent as between the parties, \"their heirs, successors and assignees.” Finally, the instrument gives the grantor and his successors and assignees the right to retake the property if a grantee fails to comply with any of the conditions and does not remedy a breach after the grantor has given notice.\\nDefendant still owns the remaining 24 acres, which are contiguous to plaintiffs property in three directions. The boundary line between these properties is exceedingly irregular. To allow defendant an opportunity to repurchase the home some day in the future, exhibit B of the original deed also reserved in defendant a right to repurchase if the property was ever sold or assigned. The right to repurchase is. also included in the appendix, but the terms can be summarized as follows.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The name of the case is The People of the State of Illinois, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. Larry Manns, Defendant-Appellant. The decision date is (1974-02-21)\\n\\nMr. JUSTICE CARTER\\ndelivered the opinion of the court:\\nThe appellant was convicted of theft exceeding $150 in 1969 in the Circuit Court of Madison County. That conviction was affirmed by this court on appeal. (People v. Manns, 1 Ill.App.3d 871, 274 N.E.2d 194.) On January 11, 1973, the appellant filed a petition in the circuit court seeking relief pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 110, sec. 72. The section 72 petition was denied by the trial judge, who had participated in the original trial.\\nThe appellant subsequently asked the circuit court to modify his sentence. The appellant had been placed upon three years probation conditioned upon paying a fine of $500 and serving a term of 90 days at the State Farm. The Unified Code of Corrections became effective on January 1, 1973, and the Code prohibits, as a condition of a sentence of probation, a sentence to a period of imprisonment (Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, sec. 1005—6—3(d)). An exception to that rule is that a sentencing court may order periodic imprisonment as a condition of probation. The circuit court, attempting to render the appellant’s sentence consistent with the new Code, modified the sentence so that the appellant was to serve weekends in the Madison County Jail for one year. The modification resulted in a sentence of incarceration of 104 days in the county jail, whereas the original order resulted in the 90-day period of incarceration at the State Farm. The three-year period of probation and the $500 fine remained a part of the penalty imposed.\\nThe appellant seeks relief from both the judgment denying section 72 relief and the order modifying his sentence.\\nIll. Rev. Stat., ch. 110, sec. 72, provides:\\n“The petition must be filed not later than two years after the entry of the order, judgment or decree. Time during which person seeking relief is under legal disability or duress or the ground for relief is fraudulently concealed shall be excluded in computing the period of two years.”',\n",

The decision date is (1983-02-14)\\n\\nIn People v. Alequin (1973), 12 Ill. App. 3d 837, 298 N.E.2d 723, and People ex rel. McLain v. Housewright (1973), 9 Ill. App. 3d 803, 293 N.E.2d 911, the charges alleging the offense of burglary did not include the statutory language “without authority” (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1971, ch. 38, par. 19— 1(a)), but the court deemed the element to have been inferred by allegation of the intent to commit a theft. Similar results have been reached in theft cases where “without authority” was not alleged, but intent to permanently deprive the owner was alleged. (People v. Wade (1970), 131 Ill. App. 2d 415, 264 N.E.2d 898; People v. Hayes (1971), 133 Ill. App. 2d 885, 272 N.E.2d 423.) On the other hand, when other allegations of the complaint do not imply the missing element, the charge fails when tested by a motion in arrest of judgment. In People v. Pruden (1982), 110 Ill. App. 3d 250, 442 N.E.2d 284, and People v. Pettus (1980), 84 Ill. App. 3d 390, 405 N.E.2d 489, lack of authority was not implied from allegations of the other elements of the offense of home invasion. Here, the information alleged that defendant’s conduct was likely to cause death or great bodily harm, but section 9 — 3(a) states that the accused’s conduct must be such as to be likely to do so and be performed recklessly. Thus, the conduct that is likely to cause death or great bodily harm does not, of itself, imply that the conduct was reckless.\\nWe are aware of no authority for judging the sufficiency of the charge by anything other than the description of the acts contained in the charge which the defendant is alleged to have performed. No case has been cited which indicates that the discovery given or the understanding of the parties can cure defects in a charge which are reached by a timely motion in the trial court.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The name of the case is The People of the State of Illinois, Defendant in Error, vs. Eugene Moore et al. Plaintiffs in Error. The decision date is (1930-12-18)\\n\\nIt is urged on behalf of defendants that the statement of the court was not sufficient to comply with the statute, and we agree, that their views in this regard must be sustained. The statute contemplates that the plea of guilty can only be entered after a defendant has been fully advised by the court of his rights and the consequences of his plea. (Krolage v. People, 224 Ill. 456.) Here the record shows there was uncertainty and confusion whether the defendants were to be sentenced for larceny or for robbery with a gun. The court and State’s attorney both encouraged the defendants to plead guilty as a means of securing a lesser punishment. The trial judge indicated that he had a right under the pleas of guilty to sentence defendants either from one year to life on the charge of robbery with a gun or from one to ten years or could place them on probation, and said that he “would be inclined to take the second view of the case — that is, from one year to ten years. I am telling you this before you enter your pleas.” Thus the defendants entered their pleas of guilty believing that by reason of the court’s statement they would riot be sentenced for robbery but would receive a sentence of from one to ten years or be placed on probation.',\n",

The decision date is (1930-12-18)\\n\\nThe record shows that at the opening of the case counsel for defendants made a statement that they were considering the withdrawal of their pleas of not guilty, and suggested that defendants would be willing to plead guilty to the minor count in the indictment, asking what would happen if they pleaded guilty to the “other charge.” There was no other charge in the indictment, which consisted of only one count, charging robbery with a gun, but evidently counsel referred to the element of larceny. The prosecutor insisted that the pleas be to the indictment. The court then told defendants that if they were not willing to rely upon him they could submit the case to a jury. The prosecutor remarked that on a plea of guilty the court had two alternatives — either to give defendants the maximum sentence, or probation; that there could be no intermediate sentence given on a plea of guilty of robbery with a gun; that “larceny carries with it the penalty of one to ten years, but if we were to go ahead before a jury on this I would nolle prosse that count.” Just what “count” the prosecutor had in mind is uncertain. The following colloquy then took place in open court:\\nThe court: “If you are willing to submit the case to the court we feel it is expediting matters and feel that the defendants are trying to save time, as far as the court is concerned, and it should be encouraged. In other words, the defendants plead guilty and there is a certainty of some punishment and there is a speedy trial. All of those points are to be considered.\\nMr. West, assistant State’s attorney: “And the parole board would also consider those points when a man is sent down on a plea of guilty.\\nThe court: “Yes. All the penal institutions are overcrowded now, and unless they enlarge these ‘hotels’ the conditions will be getting worse. They take all those things into consideration.\\nMr. West: “Well, shall we proceed, counsel?',\n",

The decision date is (1989-04-20)\\n\\nWhen the note became due on March 23, 1987, Theede met with Towle and paid $800 on the principal plus $3,367.32 in interest. Thereafter, Theede sought legal advice and learned that he was not responsible for the debts of his wife. Accordingly, he ceased payment on the note.\\nIn response, the bank, pursuant to a clause in the note, obtained a judgment by confession against Theede on August 4, 1987. Theede first learned of the judgment when he was served by a citation to discover his assets on November 25, 1987. He then filed his motion to open the judgment by confession. When the court denied his motion, he brought this appeal.\\nThe first issue presented by this case is whether the circuit court erred in concluding that the cognovit note was not used in a consumer transaction. Section 2 — 1301(c) of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 110, par. 1 — 101 et seq.) provides that any power to confess judgment in an instrument used in a consumer transaction “is null and void and any judgment entered by a court based on such power shall be unenforceable.” (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 110, par. 2 — 1301(c).) The Code further provides that a loan is a “consumer transaction” if it was made “to an individual for purposes that are primarily personal, family, or household.” Ill. Rev.

The decision date is (1974-02-21)\\n\\nUnder the Unified Code of Corrections, section 5—1—12, judgment is defined as “an adjudication by the court that the defendant is guilty or not guilty and if the adjudication is that the defendant is guilty, it includes sentence pronounced by the court”. The motion filed under section 72 must be filed within two years from the entry of judgment. (People v. Colletti, 48 Ill.2d 135.) The appellant failed to file his section 72 petition within two years of the final judgment convicting him of theft. He has not alleged that he was under a legal disability or duress or that the ground for relief has been fraudulently concealed. The appellant’s petition, therefore, was not timely, and we affirm the circuit court’s denial of that petition.\\nThe circuit court did have jurisdiction to modify the conditions of probation pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, sec. 1005—6—4(f). That provision, however, requires that a hearing be held before probation conditions are modified and the circuit court failed to hold such a hearing. We therefore vacate the order modifying the appellant’s sentence and remand the cause with directions that a hearing be held in the Circuit Court of Madison County to determine whether the probation conditions should be modified.\\nAffirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded with directions.\\nEBERSPACHER, P.

The decision date is (2007-02-08)\\n\\nIn Renn, 166 Ill. App. 3d 819, the defendant left his vehicle unattended with the keys in the ignition in a store parking lot. A thief then stole the vehicle and collided with the plaintiffs vehicle as he drove away. The reviewing court affirmed the circuit court’s order granting the defendant’s motion for summary judgment where it determined that the plaintiff failed to establish the existence of special circumstances to sustain a common law negligence claim against the defendant where plaintiff merely claimed that the defendant left the vehicle unattended in a high-crime area. Renn, 166 Ill. App. 3d at 824. In doing so, the court stated that it was unwilling to extend the ruling in Reynolds to find a duty on the defendant’s behalf absent additional allegations showing that a theft was likely to occur where the public place in which defendant parked his vehicle was a heavy traffic area. Renn, 166 Ill. App. 3d at 824.\\nHere, plaintiff argues before this court that special circumstances existed in the case at bar that made the theft of Budget’s vehicle foreseeable by asserting that Budget employees spend 200 days a year in court litigating criminal activity involving their vehicles, that Martin testified in his deposition that five previous police chases had occurred following the theft of Budget vehicles, and that three of those chases resulted in accidents. That said, plaintiff fails to assert whether those past thefts occurred at the Budget O’Hare facility and within what time frame. Further, plaintiff cites only one other instance in which a forged NRT was used to steal a vehicle from a Budget facility. As such, as in Renn, we find that plaintiff fails to establish special circumstances that made the theft in this case reasonably foreseeable, and thus she fails to establish that Budget owed her a duty of care.',\n",

The decision date is (1989-04-20)\\n\\nThe next issue is whether the circuit court erred in concluding that Theede failed to allege sufficient facts to support his asserted defenses. A trial court’s review of a motion to open a judgment by confession examines the legal sufficiency of the well-pleaded allegations of the motion as filed with its accompanying affidavits. (Gleneke v. Lesny (1970), 130 Ill. App. 2d 116, 119, 264 N.E.2d 803, 804-05.) If such allegations disclose a cognizable defense to a judgment by confession, the defendant’s motion will be granted and the cause will proceed to a hearing on the defense. (87 Ill. 2d R. 276; Harris Bank Argo v. Midpack Corp. (1986), 151 Ill. App. 3d 293, 294, 502 N.E.2d 1127, 1128.) The plaintiff may file counteraffidavits; however, its allegations are considered only to the extent that they are consistent with the allegations of the defendant. 87 Ill. 2d R. 276; First National Bank v.

Abrams, 211 Ill. 2d at 264. Specifically, the court held that the City’s refusal was not the legal cause of the plaintiffs injuries because it could not have reasonably anticipated that its refusal to send the ambulance would result in the plaintiffs friend driving through a red light and colliding with another vehicle driven by a substance-impaired driver. Abrams, 211 Ill. 2d at 261-62.\\nThe record here shows that only one other alleged incident involving an NRT had resulted in the theft of a vehicle from a Budget facility. As such, defendants could not have reasonably foreseen that the accident in this case would result from their decision to leave the keys in the ignition of the 1997 Ford Explorer and the subsequent release of the vehicle pursuant to a forged NRT.\\nMoreover, the accident in the case at bar occurred eight days after the theft and 26 miles from the Budget O’Hare facility. In Stanko v. Zilien, 33 Ill. App. 2d 364 (1961), a case similar to the one at bar, the defendant, a used automobile dealer, left the keys of its vehicles in the keys of their ignition during business hours while the vehicles were parked on the defendant’s private lot. Consequently, a thief substituted the keys of one of defendant’s vehicles during the day and returned at night to steal the vehicle. Twelve days later and forty-one and a half blocks away from defendant’s place of business, the stolen vehicle driven by the thief struck the plaintiffs vehicle. On appeal, this court upheld the circuit court’s grant of summary judgment. In reaching that holding, this court stated:',\n",

App. 2d 27 (1965), violated the same statute as in Ney where it had a practice of leaving its vehicles parked on a public street with the keys in the ignitions. Subsequently, thieves stole one of the defendant’s vehicles, and the stolen vehicle was involved in an accident with the plaintiff a day later. The plaintiff filed suit against the dealer, and the circuit court entered judgment for the plaintiff.\\nOn appeal, this court, like the supreme court in Ney, stated that a statutory violation was prima facie evidence of negligence. Kacena, 63 Ill. App. 2d at 33. Further, despite the remoteness in time and distance of the accident from the defendant dealer, this court found that a question of fact existed as to probable cause and thus affirmed the circuit court’s ruling denying the defendant’s motions for a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Kacena, 63 Ill. App. 2d at 39.\\nIn both Ney and Kacena, the defendants’ vehicles were stolen while parked on public property in violation of a state statute. In analyzing the liability of the defendants, the courts determined that the statutory violations were prima facie evidence of negligence and thus confined their discussion to the existence of proximate cause. As noted in Ruyle v. Reynolds, 43 Ill. App. 3d 905, 907 (1976), the rule in Ney, and consequently Kacena, and the statute therein have been limited to cases involving public streets.',\n",
